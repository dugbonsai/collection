Darniche/A. Mahé</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2012<BR/><BR/>Alpines destroyed the other manufacturers in the inaugural season of the WRC winning 6 of the 13 rounds. The next most successful (Fiat) won only 2 and others won only 1. This was win #3 for Alpine and the first for Darniche &amp; Mahé.<BR/><BR/>A nice offering from Troféu but the tires look to be way oversized to me. A minor nit is the decals for door handles.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
