Due to the worldwide oil crisis, the inaugural season’s 13 events were reduced to 8. Timo Mäkinen competed in 3 of the events driving a Peugeot 504 with John Davenport on the Safari Rally and a Ford Escort RS1600 with Henry Liddon on the 1,000 Lakes Rally and RAC Rally.<BR/><BR/>After finishing second in his &quot;home&quot; event, Mäkinen was surely looking to repeat his win in the 1973 RAC Rally. Mäkinen took the lead from Sandro Munari driving a Lancia Stratos in SS18. He was able to hold on to the lead through the next 62  :!: contested special stages to win the event. At the time there was still no Driver’s Championship but the win earned Ford 20 points in the Manufacturers’ Championship. Ford ended the season in third place behind Lancia and Fiat. <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/worldrallyarchive/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=835158103209241\">World Rally Archive. 1973-1993 - Photos | Facebook</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_World_Rally_Championship\">1974 World Rally Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/eventstats/12365-lombard-rac-rally-1974/\">Stats Lombard RAC Rally 1974</A><BR/>"}
