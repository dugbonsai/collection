Yanagida</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The Japanese Touring Car Championship started in the late 1960s. With the emergence of Group 5 cars in the later half of the 1970s, the series was replaced by Super Silhouettes in 1979, which was held as a support race to the Fuji Grand Champion Series. The field for the inaugural event in 1979 consisted of Japanâ€™s Group 5 cars from the years prior. One of those cars was the Turbo Violet which was raced 5 years earlier and mainly outside of Japan due to the oil crisis. Haru Yanagida drove the sole Violet - seen below - to victory in the 1979 Fuji Masters 250km. <BR/><BR/>The model was one of the last released by the sorely missed (by me, anyway) Japanese model shop P-4.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://fcyap.blogspot.com/2014/11/leads-and-clues-to-demystifying-orange.html\">A Datsun Turbo Violet from 1974: Leads and clues to demystifying the orange &quot;1974 Fuji Shakedown&quot; and yellow &quot;1979 Super Silhouette Fuji #20&quot; Datsun 160J SSS KP710 Violet Turbo.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=3059\">Search from circuit information | JAF motor sports</A><BR/>"}
