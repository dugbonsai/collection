Takechi/Y. Katayama</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/><BR/>In July 1968 Mazda released the revolutionary Familia Rotary Coupe or R100 as it was known in some markets. This was one of the first mass produced rotary engine powered cars, and offered exhilarating performance from its 982cc twin rotor Wankel engine.<BR/><BR/>In 1969 Mazda took the R100 racing and achieved a creditable 5th and 6th at the Spa 24 Hours. The race versions used the Type 10A peripheral port engine like in the Cosmo Sport and generating close to 200 bhp.<BR/><BR/>Buoyed by their 1969 successes they took four cars to Spa for the 1970 24 Hour race. They qualified as high as sixth and started strongly. At the halfway point, the R100 driven by Yoshimi Katayama and Toshinori Takechi held the lead over a BMW 2800 CS, with the other three rotary cars close behind in 3rd, 4th and 8th. Then, with only four hours to the chequered flag, disaster struck. One car suffered engine trouble and had to retire. Soon after, a strange noise developed in the engine of Katayamaâ€™s lead car, eventually forcing him to stop. The same problem also ended the hopes of the third car. The final R100 just managed to stave off the engine problems and complete its final lap to scrape through in 5th place.<BR/><BR/>This is a model of the race-leading #31 car of Yoshimi Katayama and Toshinori Takechi which failed to finish due to engine problems.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>"}
