Burt</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>By the final season of the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC) in 1998, Nissan and Honda had withdrawn from the series. This meant that Toyota (with the Corona EXIV and Chaser) had the only factory-backed entires with a Subaru Impreza Wagon as the only other competition in the first 3 rounds (maybe it should have been called Japanese Toyotas -  Corona &amp; Chaser). The only question at the beginning of the season was would a Corona or a Chaser win the championship? The Chaser driven by Masanori Sekiya won the championship with Brit Kelvin Burt taking 5th place overall (and a win in round 5 at SUGO) in the Toyota Team TOMâ€™s Chaser seen here.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://gymlive.org/su_san_motorsports/photo/1758312578700172445_7046837206\">@ su_san_motorsports - su_san_motorsport - 1998 season, which was the final year of JTCC ...</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">1998 Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/race/list.cgi?type=TC\">1998 JTCC Series | JAF Motorsport</A><BR/>"}
