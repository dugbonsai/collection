Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.ebbro.jp/SHOP/44188.html<BR/><BR/>Masahiko Kageyama raced for the Calsonic Hoshino Racing team in the 1994 JGTC Series. The 1994 JGTC season was the first full season of the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship. Kageyama won round 1 at Mt. Fuji and finished in the top 5 in the remaining 4 rounds. These results gave Kageyama the GT1 class win. The now familiar GT300 &amp; GT500 classes were not adopted until 1995. In 1994 there were GT1 &amp; GT2 classes which were essentially the same as the FIA GT1 &amp; GT2 classes. At the time, JGTC teams the freedom to enter whichever cars they preferred. Looking at the entry lists from the races you will find all kinds of cars, some of the more interesting choices being:<BR/>Ferrari F40<BR/>Lamborghini Countach<BR/>Porsche 962C<BR/>Lancia 037<BR/>BMW M3<BR/><BR/>By the end of the season the cost of attaining an FIA GT1 car increased dramatically. In order to keep costs down and determined not to go the same way as the Japan Sports Prototype Championship (JSPC) series for Group C &amp; IMSA GTP prototype cars it replaced, the GT300 &amp; GT500 classes were introduced.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
