According to HPI’s blog, this is a model of the minimally liveried car as raced in Round 4 where Okimoto &amp; Yamada finished in 4th place. For whatever reason, these are the only 2 touring car events that Okimoto &amp; Yamada ever competed in.<BR/><BR/>If you check out the March 5, 2012 entry in HPI’s blog (link below) you can see thy had plans to release the 1991 Bathurst winner but that never happened.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130919152315/http://hpimodelcar-usblog.com/?month=201203\">Article of March 2012 | HPI USA Modelcar Blog</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://touringcarracing.net/Races/1992%20Sendai.html\">1991 AJTCC - round 4</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-driver.cgi?driver_id=1864\">Tatsuhara Okimoto | JAF motor sports</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-driver.cgi?driver_id=668\">Eiji Yamada | JAF motor sports</A><BR/>"}
