Kageyama/É. Comas</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Masami Kageyama &amp; Érik Comas drove the #23 Castrol Pitwork Nissan Skyline for the Nismo team in the 2002 JGTC Series. The overall red &amp; sliver color scheme is the same as the <A HREF=\"https://scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=367687#p367687\">sister #22 Xanavi car</A> with some differences in sponsor logos. The car seen here is the 2.6L RB26-powered version used for the first half of the season. Mid-way through the season the engine was changed to the new, more powerful 3.0L VQ30 engine. Kageyama &amp; Comas had better results in the first half of the season with 4th &amp; 6th place finishes in rounds 3 &amp; 2 respectively. They finished the season in 19th place in the GT500 class.<BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://gtr-registry.com/forum/forum/main-forum/1224-23-castrol-pitwork-r34-gtr-2002-season\">#23 Castrol Pitwork R34 GTR (2002 Season) - GTR-Registry Forums</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_All_Japan_Grand_Touring_Car_Championship\">2002 All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
