Olofsson/N. Hattori/D. Brabham</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The GT-R name was first used on Skylines from 1969-1972 when they racked up 50 class or outright victories (the first 49 consecutively). After that the name would not be used again until 16 years later when it was revived in 1989.<BR/><BR/>At the time Nissan was racing the R31 Skyline in Group A but wanted to retire it for a more competitive vehicle. That vehicle was the R32 GT-R. It was designed to dominate Group A racing with a 600+ bhp twin turbo straight-six engine (in race trim) and all-wheel-drive inspired by the Porsche 959.<BR/><BR/>One year after the roadgoing R32 GT-R&apos;s introduction it was homolgated for Group A racing and quickly emerged as a dominant force in Japanese and Australian racing.<BR/><BR/>The R32 GT-R was successful outside of Asia as well. In the 1991 Spa 24 Hours race Nissan entered just one car in the Group A class. The Nissan works Zexel GT-R was driven by Anders Olofsson, Naoki Hattori, and David Brabham. Olofsson qualified first, winning pole by 0.8 seconds.<BR/><BR/>Despite strong competition from the BMW M3s, the GT-R never lost the pace during the race and won (the Group A class and the race outright). This would be Nissan&apos;s only win at Spa and they did not return until 2016.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/07/29/feature-when-brabham-and-gt-r-stormed-spa/\">FEATURE: When Brabham and GT-R stormed Spa - Speedcafe</A> (image)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a27737/nissan-skyline-gt-r-godzilla-history/\">How the Nissan Skyline GT-R Became &apos;Godzilla&apos;</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=0JWlaTqB8V0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gt-r&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9j7nkyvzJAhWihoMKHbjUABcQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gt-r&amp;f=false\">Nissan GT-R Supercar: Born to Race - Dennis Gorodji - Google Books</A><BR/>"}
