Wada</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The second generation Nissan Sunny - the B110 - was first raced in November, 1970 and was still being raced competitively 12 years later. The car seen here was driven by Takao Wada in the 1982 Fuji Masters 250km Race. By this time the Sunny was the car of choice and, of the 24 cars in the race, 20 were Sunnys.<BR/><BR/>Going into the final round of the 1982 Fuji Minor Touring (MT) Championship Wada was leading the Championship by just 1 point over Hikari Hagiwara. Wada &amp; Haigwara were both driving for Advan but their cars were prepared by different tuners. Wada’s Sunny was prepared by Tsuchiya (Keiichi Tsuchiya the drift king) and Hagiwara’s Sunny was prepared by Tomei (also known as <A HREF=\"http://www.tomei-p.co.jp\">Tomei Powered</A>). This race would not only decide the wining driver, but the winning tuner.<BR/><BR/>For the majority of the race Wada &amp; Hagiwara battled with the Honda Civic of Yoshio Oba and another Sunny driven by Eiji Shibuya. They were not able to overtake Oba &amp; Shibuya and ultimately finished in 3rd and 4th respectively. The gap between Wada &amp; Hagiwara was as close as it could be - .1 seconds but it was just enough to ensure that Wada won the championship. This was his first MT championship and the last time the Sunny was raced in the MT series.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www2.tokai.or.jp/sunny/82-10-24.htm\">B110 Sunny last Minor touring race</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.mamegyorai.co.jp/net/main/item_detail/item_detail.aspx?item=366364\">1982 Fuji Minor Touring Advan Tachiya and Sunny #24 1/43 ENIF0009</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=879\">1982 Fuji Masters 250km Race | JAF motor sports</A><BR/>"}
