This is another Ebbro x HPI collaboration model of the #1 Calsonic car but from 1996 this time. This one is from round 2: All Japan GT Fuji. Masahiko Kageyama and Kazuyoshi Hoshino qualified in 11th place and fought their way through the field to finish in a respectable 5th place. Especially since the top 4 finishers started in 2nd - 5th place! To me it looks like there&apos;s a lot more noticeable differences between this one and the two 1995 models previously posted.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Fuji-1996-05-04-3441.html\">All Japan GT Fuji 1996 - Race Results - Racing Sports Cars</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://supergt.net/archive/classic/supergt.net/jgtc/ex/gtc_cham/1996/cha96_2/cha96_2.htm\">GTC Official Web Site - GT Championship 1996 - R2</A><BR/>"}
