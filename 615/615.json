The rally continued through Morocco, Mauritania, Mail, Guinea, and Senegal for a total of 2991 miles of special stages.<BR/><BR/>Once in Africa, the expected battle between Mitsubishi and Volkswagen started setting up with a clear advantage to the Japanese brand immediately after entering Mauritania. But title-holder Stéphane Peterhansel, who seemed untouchable in the sand, hit a tree in stage 12 giving his teammate Luc Alphand his first stage win. Alphand, who remained at the same level of excellence all along the event, claimed 2 stage wins and his first Dakar: a winning switch for the former alpine skier.<BR/><BR/>Sources<BR/><A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Dakar_Rally\" TARGET=\"_blank\">2006 Dakar Wikipedia entry</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=207028#p207028\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=207028#p207028\" TARGET=\"_blank\">http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=207028#p207028</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images94?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCNntxcnB2tTe8gE&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images94?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCNntxcnB2tTe8gE&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Norev La Légende Du Dakar #21 Mitsubishi Pajero Evolution MPR12 2006 Dakar Rally Winner L.

Picard</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2009<BR/><BR/>Only win for Luc Alphand<BR/>11th Dakar win for Mitsubishi<BR/>11th Dakar win for Pajero (only win for Pajero Evolution MPR12)<BR/><BR/>Mitsubishi Motors made history in 2006 when Luc Alphand &amp; Gilles Picard won the Dakar Rally, claiming a record-breaking 11th overall victory and 6th consecutive win for the Japanese manufacturer on this legendary rally. The outright success was the first for Alphand - runner-up in 2008 and a former World Downhill skiing champion - and the second for his French co-driver Gilles Picard, who had won the Dakar with fellow countryman Jean-Pierre Fontenay in 1998.<BR/><BR/>Alphand &amp; Picard took the outright lead between Bamako in Mali and Labé in Guinea, when former multiple winner Stéphane Peterhansel crashed into a tree and damaged his rear suspension and transmission. Despite fierce pressure from second-placed South African driver Giniel de Villiers, Alphand took few risks over the closing three days of the 15-leg event to record a winning margin of 17 minutes and 53 seconds after the final timed section near Dakar was cancelled.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
