The rally continued for 2,991 competitive miles through Morocco, Mauritania, Mail, Guinea, and finished in Dakar, Senegal on January 15, 2006.<BR/><BR/>The European specials provided an opportunity for the local drivers to shine. Once in Africa, however, the expected battle between Mitsubishi and Volkswagen started setting up with a clear advantage going to the Japanese brand immediately after entering Mauritania. <BR/><BR/>Despite not winning any stages, Bruno Saby and Michel Périn finished in a respectable 8th place.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images208?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCL2i5PzU5_3uTg&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images208?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCL2i5PzU5_3uTg&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
