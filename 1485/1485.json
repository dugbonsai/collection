Okamoto/Y. Terada</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/><BR/>The second of Kyosho&apos;s recent batch of RX-3s. About as different from the previous livery as you can get. The dashboard seems off to me as it looks like it covers the bottom half of the windscreen.  :!:  :?: <BR/><BR/>Although Okamoto and Terada were leading at one point they finished 4th. <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
