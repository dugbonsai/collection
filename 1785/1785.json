Waldegård/H. Thorszelius</b><BR/><BR/>13th WRC win for Björn Waldegård<BR/>5th WRC win for Toyota<BR/>2nd WRC win for Celica Twincam Turbo<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>In September 1982, the first Toyota Celica turbo was launched in Japan for the local market only - the GT-T (TA63). This was used as the basis for Toyota&apos;s Group B  Celica Twincam Turbo (TA64).<BR/><BR/>While most other manufacturers opted for four-wheel drive, the Celica Twincam Turbo (and Lancia 037) retained a rear-wheel drive powertrain. The 2.1-litre engine could produce up to 380bhp, making the TA64 one of the most powerful two-wheel drive rally cars ever built.<BR/><BR/>The car made its debut on the 1983 1,000 lakes Rally and was driven by Juha Kankkunen to a sixth place finish. On its next outing it was an outright winner, piloted by Björn Waldegård to victory on the 1984 Ivory Coast Rally.<BR/><BR/>The car proved to be particularly strong and reliable which made it ideal for the gruelling African events. Between 1984 and 1986 it scored a hat-trick of Safari Rally &amp; Ivory Coast rally victories.<BR/><BR/>Its dominance in these long-distance rallies was ended when the Group B format was dropped at the end of 1986 and replaced with the lower-powered Group A cars.<BR/><BR/>I made a mistake on the Marlboro decals. I didn&apos;t realize until after they were applied that the 1984 car doesn&apos;t have a thick black border around the number plates so the Marlboro decal should be wider than the decals for the 1985 &amp; 1986 cars. :angry: <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.2000gt.net/Competition/Rally/Rallye.php\">Toyota en rallye</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Celica#Twincam_Turbo_Group_B_Rally_Car\">Toyota Celica - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://media.toyota.co.uk/2012/06/toyota-celica-twin-cam-turbo-ta64-group-b-rally-car/\">TOYOTA CELICA TWIN-CAM TURBO TA64 GROUP B RALLY CAR - Toyota UK Media Site</A><BR/><BR/>"}
