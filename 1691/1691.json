Volvo decided there should be no direct successor to the T-5R, but due to its huge hand in improving Volvo&apos;s image and the big sales success Volvo decided to develop a new high performance model. Production of the 850 R ran between 1996–97 (the final year of the 850) and unlike the T-5R was not limited. Various Volvo sources estimate between 5000–7000 of all 850 R variants were produced and sold worldwide. The only colours available were Bright Red, Black Stone, Dark Grey Pearl, Dark Olive Pearl, Turquoise Pearl and Polar White.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_850#850_R\">Volvo 850 - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/235876099203095137/\">Volvo on Pinterest</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
