Olofsson/A. Suzuki</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: <A HREF=\"http://www.ebbro.jp/SHOP/43671.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">http://ebbro.co.jp/item_race/nissan/43671.html</A><BR/><BR/>The Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC) began in 1985 and was Japan&apos;s Group A championship series. Instead of sprint races (common in Europe) it was a long-distance championship with races over 300 or 500 km. Apart from imported cars like BMW or Ford, there were many Japanese cars taking part - and with great results, especially at the end of Group A in the early 1990s.<BR/><BR/>Anders Olofsson and Aguri Suzuki drove this Skyline GTS-R in the 1988 JTCC series. The first victory for the 6-cylinder Skyline and for Olofsson &amp; Suzuki came in the first race of the season at Suzuka. The leading car had hard tires while Olofsson/Suzkui had opted for soft tires at the start of the race. Once the temperature dropped - 10 laps into the race - the Skyline took the lead and was never challenged again. The only other win came in round 2 at Nishi Nippon and they went on to finish 2nd overall in Division 1.<BR/><BR/>Source: <A HREF=\"http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1988%20AJTCC.html\">All-Japan Touring Car Championship - 1988</A><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
