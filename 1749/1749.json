Kankkunen/J. Piironen</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The 1986 Acropolis Rally was held just 1 month after the tragic 1986 Tour de Corse - Rallye de France and the announced ban on Group B for the 1987 season. Peugeot brought 3 205 T16 E2s to the event for the teams of TImo Salonen/Seppo Harjanne, Juha Kankkunen/Juha Piironen, and Bruno Saby/Jean-François Fauchille.<BR/><BR/>Through SS17 it was looking like Ford might get their first win with their RS200 as Kalle Grundel led for 8 of the 12 stages (5 were cancelled). Grundel later had to stop for a wheel change and some of the nuts proved stubborn causing one to seize completely which started to turn the stud. There was no alternative but to change the hub, an operation which took longer than the maximum lateness of half an hour so Ford’s hopes and Grundel’s rally came to an end.<BR/><BR/>Kankkunen took advantage of Grundel’s misfortune and took the rally lead in SS18 and held on to it all the way through to SS46 and the end of the rally. With this win, Kankkunen’s first 4 WRC victories were achieved on his first attempt at the event. The previous 3 being the Safari Rally (1985), Rallye Côte d’Ivoire (1985), and the Swedish Rally (1986).<BR/><BR/>This is IXO’s model of Kankkunen’s winning car.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://rallyazores.blogspot.gr/2011/06/acropolis-rally-1986.html\">RALLYAZORES: ACROPOLIS RALLY 1986</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/july-1986/84/acropolis-rally\">Acropolis Rally | Motorsport Magazine Archive</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juha_Kankkunen#WRC_victories\">Juha Kankkunen - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
