Marreau/B. Marreau</B><BR/><BR/>The 1983 Dakar departed from Place de la Concorde in Paris on January 1 and took competitors through France, Algeria, Niger, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania and finishing in Dakar, Senegal on January 20 for a total of 3,237 miles. There was no scheduled rest day which meant 20 straight days of driving but a violent sandstorm caused the cancellation of several specials forcing 3 rest days!<BR/><BR/>After previously taking on the Dakar in a Renault 4 in 1979 and a Renault 20 in 1982, the Marreau brothers were again loyal to the French maker. This year they set out in a Renault 18 4x4. For the launch of the R18 4x4 the Marreaus were given two very special R18s. They were equipped with the same engine as the previous year&apos;s R20 but with a turbocharger, a full 4WD transmission, long-travel suspension, and general body reinforcements.<BR/><BR/>In the end, the Marreaus had their worst performance yet finishing in 9th place - due to a shortage of gasoline - with 2 stage wins.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://ptikem.free.fr/racing.htm\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Renault 14 and 18 : racing</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images202?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCKPmrurq-7yvag&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images202?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCKPmrurq-7yvag&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
