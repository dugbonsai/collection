Yoshida/K. Koizumi</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>2006 was the third year that HPI sponsored the Team Prova Subaru Impreza STI entered in the Japanese Super Taikyu endurance race series. Toshihiro Yoshida &amp; Kazuhiro Koizumi drove this Impreza in the ST-2 class for 2,001cc - 2,500cc 4WD vehicles. HPI was keen to point out that Koizumi started his racing career driving radio controlled cars in the early 1990s, competing at many top 1/10th scale buggy and on-road races around the world. If I had to guess Iâ€™d say these were HPI R/C cars. Yoshida &amp; Koizumi went on the finish the season in second place.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://hondaf1.blog48.fc2.com/blog-entry-4010.html\">Capricorn Photo - Challenging Spirit</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070209122901/http://www.so-net.ne.jp/s-taikyu/ranking/index.html\">Welcom to Super Taikyu Net</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.hpiracing.com/en/article/view/2006032201\">HPI Racing continues sponsorship of Team Prova Impreza! at HPI Racing Award-winning radio control cars and trucks</A><BR/>"}
