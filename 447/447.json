Cresto</b><BR/><BR/>25th WRC win for Lancia<BR/>2nd WRC win for Delta S4<BR/>3rd WRC win for Henri Toivonen<BR/><BR/>The 1986 WRC season was shaping up to be the most exciting seasons yet with all of the major manufacturers entering their Group B cars in the championship. Henri Toivonen &amp; Sergio Cresto kicked off the season with a decisive win in the first rally of the year - Monte Carlo. They led for 30 of the 36 stages and beat the Peugeot team that was dominant in 1985. After some fatal accidents involving the Group B monsters, the FIA announced the end of Group B later in the season. This would be Toivonen&apos;s last win before his &amp; Cersto&apos;s death four months later in Corsica.<BR/><BR/>This is the night version of the car from HPI.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.redbull.com/en/motorsports/offroad/stories/1331671038274/wrc-rally-heroes-ogier-latvala-evans-østberg-hirvonen\">Ogier, Latvala, Evans, Østberg, Hirvonen’s rally heroes</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
