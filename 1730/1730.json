The engine was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission, the latter of which was not available in the US. The T-5R was renowned as a sleeper car; despite its boxy, understated appearance, it boasted a drag coefficient of 0.29 and was capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 - 6.0 seconds. The top speed was electronically limited to 152.2 mph. The engine tuning was co-developed with Porsche, as was the transmission and other powertrain components. Porsche also aided in designing some of the interior, such as the Alcantara seat inserts.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GCRjNK8MYZu5-h1MhRll6h7A5_zF1WmPtiMVLmEaLWwtlP1XyIfORzQtNjwyAEteSBtFBv_KEWOax40N6uJof93bPpTeWgEXtPZCPt9bgpkexgX1KeDvxOsRfWo5ZTV6C0Ux4EbtmZ6b8dBBALz7wxDod29oUT4Qww8ydEQbbZnFM-KuPIIjJrzR6ZcyfN93AnBgLzmNQzDgEfhIqviFv8L106ndUEDpA8sp9io4m0RLe8i-B5MVaPNvvapW7mYUeK2FlrUnjwtZ9rpYTvv7xGp1DT9gEfwWDdyhxgI4AqOV01IXNkV8S3w9VaoliqkO9Vci0ar2f6rXladgCuFrs6uQ4xOMTLPF9MN2dKY6IuxdPnMq9nviCS7DfmLM-45_MuMXk5eTiS0Ckd9SK3uoYmZWhN6YrEPdSFNxomHC0wgJMBfRooIH8GNsRtep0xdQe6VzXO3t3h8tnVYVJydP-VzOCnyYe5zfIgVhx7d_fx7pUOwEkkS55yYMMx0-9J3SAQbvIk_rAyvp4mkQvj7N6hSY5fM0OJtdCjHyJb46MHW9ihlEEjX1Ojtht3kgMOIP9CWk5sVFojQJ7m-GsOOARciStA_hnBPxT1HYDYepstTsndu8G6wt-ZYtjc3TZYf9NRD6zaTffjXERMpdw2pQoNimuzzpJ6z1pSVZH1mD56jM5Ck=w3136\"> </A> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.motortrend.com/news/volvo-celebrates-its-85th-birthday-we-pick-our-8-5-favorite-volvos-192629/#1995-volvo-850-t5-r-wagon-rear-three-quarter\">Volvo Celebrates Its 85th Birthday, We Pick Our 8.5 Favorite Volvos</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_850#850_T-5R\">Volvo 850 - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
