Greenly/J. Dunk</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: [url]http://ebbro.co.jp/item_race/nissan/43662.html[/url]<BR/>Purchased: 2013<BR/><BR/>(from <A HREF=\"http://www.datsunhistory.com/Safari1.html\">Datsun and The East African Safari Rally</A>)<BR/><BR/>At the 14th East African Safari Rally held in 1966, Nissan made history as this vehicle was the first Japanese car to win in its class (under 1,300cc). A pair of Bluebird P411s driven by the teams of John Greenly/John Dunk and Jock Aird/Robin Hillyar came in 5th and 6th overall and 1st and 2nd in class. More importantly, both cars completed the course in a race that 88 cars entered and only 9 finished. <BR/><BR/>As for the model it&apos;s a nice effort from Ebbro but just now noticed its missing the Coca Cola logos on the rear fenders! <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
