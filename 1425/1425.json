Loeb (#97 of 1000)</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/><BR/>&quot;Loosely&quot; based on the shape and design of the production 208, the T16 is vehicle that uses the rear wing from the Peugeot 908, and has a 3.2-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine, developing 875 bhp. I think we all know by now what SÃ©bastien Loeb was able to do with this car. Keep in mind that Peugeot created this from scratch in just 6 months. Check out <A HREF=\"http://www.speedhunters.com/2013/10/have-wings-will-fly-inside-the-peugeot-208-t16-pikes-peak/\">Have Wings, Will Fly: Inside The Peugeot 208 T16 Pikes Peak at Speedhunters</A> for more details. Some fun numbers:<BR/><BR/><b>Power to weight ratio</b>: 1:1 875hp/875kg<BR/><b>0-100km/h</b>: 1.8sec<BR/><b>0-200km/h</b>: 4.8sec<BR/><b>top speed</b>: 240km/h<BR/><BR/>The model is exactly would you would expect from Spark - fantastic. The odd thing is that after the little metal plaque reading &quot;0097 of 1000&quot; fell off (glad that didn&apos;t happen in transit) the base read &quot;120/750pcs.&quot; I guess I can understand increasing overall production but the 120th piece now being the 97th is odd. Just goes to show that the whole &quot;<b>#x of</b> y&quot; business is kind of silly. Also I really hate photographing black cars. Even when you think it&apos;s clean it&apos;s not.
