Although I wasn&apos;t able to find any photos (yet) they probably looked something like this one driven by Paul Newman:<BR/><BR/><BR/>In 1980 and 1981 private teams used a Nissan Violet 710 and a Silvia S110 and Nissan supplied them with parts like the LZ20B engine. The S110 only had two wins during those early years. I&apos;ve had no luck finding a racing Violet 710 from this era but here is a what the Silvia S110 looked like:<BR/><BR/><BR/>In 1982 they teamed up with Nissan and had a line up of the Skyline KDR30, Silvia S12, and the Bluebird 910. Here is some great footage of all 3 in action in the same race: https://youtu.be/lg7QpcPXELk?t=3m7s<BR/><BR/>Ebbro&apos;s model seen below is the Nissan Skyline Turbo Group 5 launch car. Again, I have not been able to find any photos of the real thing, only a <A HREF=\"https://picclick.com/Gunze-Sangyo-Motorized-Nissan-Skyline-turbo-group-5-382046582718.html\">1:24 Gunze Sangyo kit</A> that looks exactly like this. A nice model model from Ebbro but it looks like the front tire is trying to eat the wheel.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://static.modestmachines.com/archive/nissan-skyline-super-silhouette\">Nissan Skyline Super Silhouette â€” Modest Machines</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.datsunhistory.com/Racehistory1.html\">Race History 1</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.tomeipowered.com/BTE/index.php/tomei-history/2735/\">TOMEI USA &gt;&gt; Tomei History: 1981-1982 - Nissan Silvia S110 Part 1.</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
