C. Verney/M. Thatcher/J. Garnier</B><BR/><BR/>The 1982 Dakar departed from Place de la Concorde in Paris on January 1 and took competitors through France, Algeria, Mali, and finishing in Dakar, Senegal on January 20 for a total of 3,705 competitive miles.<BR/><BR/>In 1979 engineer Henry Dangel successfully tested the first Peugeot 504 4x4 prototype. The next year the Dangel company was founded and production of Peugeot 504 estate and pick-up 4x4s started. 12 Peugeot 504 Dangels started the Dakar in 1982 but only 1 of them finished - in 49th place.<BR/><BR/>One of the 11 504s that did not finish belonged to the team of Anne-Charlotte Verney, Mark Thatcher, and Jacky Garnier. This created quite a sensation as Mark Thatcher is the son of Margaret Thatcher who was the British Prime Minister at the time.<BR/><BR/>This was Thatcher&apos;s first Paris-Dakar rally, but he told the BBC before the race that this did not worry him. &quot;I&apos;ve now raced in Le Mans and other things - this rally is no problem,&quot; he said. <BR/><BR/>Thatcher, his co-driver, and mechanic went missing on January 9 near the Mali-Algeria border. They had been traveling in convoy with two other cars but became separated after stopping to repair a steering arm. At dusk - lost and now also with a shattered rear axle casing - they set up camp and stopped to wait for help. The three were discovered safe and well on January 15, six days after going missing and 31 miles off-route. They were spotted by a C13Q Hercules search plane belonging to the Algerian air force.<BR/><BR/>Thatcher seemed unaffected by the ordeal, saying that all he needed was &quot;a beer and a sandwich, a bath and a shave&quot;.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dangel.fr/dates_clefs_en.html?newlg=E\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Dangel 4x4 milestones</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakardantan.com/paris-dakar-1982/classement.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Classement du Paris Dakar 1982 - 390 participants</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/12/newsid_2523000/2523841.stm\" TARGET=\"_blank\">BBC ON THIS DAY | 12 | 1982: Mark Thatcher missing in Sahara</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images199?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCO6NwN6S18OzHg&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images199?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCO6NwN6S18OzHg&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
