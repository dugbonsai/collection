J. Lehto<BR/>Only Le Mans win for Masanori Sekiya<BR/><BR/>McLaren&apos;s win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995 was an incredible accomplishment considering the F1 GT-R was essentially a road car competing against purpose-built prototype racers. It was also noteworthy as they won on their first attempt. McLaren&apos;s <A HREF=\"http://cars.mclaren.com/featured-articles/le-mans-memories-lett-harding.html\">site</A> says they are the only manufacturer to win on their first attempt but they seem to be wrong for 2 reasons:<BR/><BR/>[list]<BR/><b>Only manufacturer?</b> Chenard &amp; Walcker won the first event and therefore were definitely the first manufacturer to win on their first attempt. :lol:  The <A HREF=\"http://www.lemans-history.com/equip_venc.php?tipo=1\">Le Mans History site</A> also lists Ferrari (1949), Dauer (1994), &amp; TWR (1996) as manufacturers that won on their first attempt<BR/><BR/><b>First attempt?</b> In <A HREF=\"http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Le_Mans-1981-06-14.html\">1981 a McLaren M12 GT</A> was entered but did not qualify. I guess technically the McLaren did not compete but it was entered.<BR/>[/list]<BR/><BR/>This is the night version of the car made specially for <A HREF=\"http://www.kidbox.co.jp\">KIDBOX in Japan</A>. There is an alignment issue with the gray part of the bodywork at the bottom of the car. The 2 parts are not flush where they meet at the bottom point of the door. I&apos;ve seen this issue in photos of this and other other HPI McLaren models.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.lemans-history.com/equip_venc.php?tipo=1\">Le Mans History: Winners</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/clicks_1000/10859505075\">1995 Le Mans Winner McLaren F1 GTR (Lehto Dalmas Sekiya) -â€¦ | Flickr</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
