I don&apos;t know the details of exactly how they came up with the name &apos;Elephant&apos; but apparently the team agreed that was a good name for their support trucks.<BR/><BR/>This rally truck is based on a 4x4 Ginaf X2222 truck chassis with a cabin from an X2222. Most of the other components have been replaced including the engine (a 950HP inline-6 Caterpillar C18 engine) and transmission (a 16-speed ZF gearbox rated at over 1600 ft-lb of torque). The suspension has been replaced with Vehicle Systems Engineering&apos;s microprocessor-controlled DTS suspension system which allows independent control of each wheel&apos;s suspension and damping. All of this enables the Elephant 3 to travel across the landscape at nearly 100 mph.<BR/><BR/>So, how did Elephant 3 fare in the Dakar? The team finished in a respectable 27th place (respectable because many teams don&apos;t even finish). Maybe more importantly, Jos kept his word to his 80-year old father when he promised that he would return Elephant 3 undamaged.<BR/><BR/>Sources<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.rallyteamsmink.nl/\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Een huis, een zon en een boekâ€¦!!</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.v-s-e.nl/home.html?L=1\" TARGET=\"_blank\">VSE: Vehicle Systems Engineering BV the Netherlands</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images308?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCP_Y8Pzt-cPtUg&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images308?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCP_Y8Pzt-cPtUg&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
