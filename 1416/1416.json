From <A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallye_Sanremo#History\">Wikipedia</A>: The rally became the centre of controversy in 1986 after the stewards disqualified the factory Peugeot team at the end of the third day for using illegal side skirts, handing the victory to Lancia. Peugeot had used the same configuration in earlier rallies without any scrutineering problems and had also passed pre-rally scrutineering. Peugeot appealed but the organizers did not allow the team to continue the rally. FIA later confirmed that the exclusion had been illegal as the Peugeot cars were legal, and decided to annul the results of the whole event.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
