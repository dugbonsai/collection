Kageyama/R. Lyons</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>2003 was the 5th - and final - season for the R34 GT-R in the JGTC series. The R34 took the GT500 Class title in its debut season in 1999 but was not able to secure a second title after that. With the Fiarlady Z set to replace the it, there was a big push to secure a second title for the  R34. To help secure that second title Nissan made improvements to the car in the off-season and paired experience with youth on the 3 teams. In the #22 car, 1998 JGTC champion Masami Kageyama was paired with up-and-coming driver Richard Lyons.<BR/><BR/>Kageyama &amp; Lyons scored the R34â€™s first win for the season in Round 2 at Fuji speedway. This was the only win for them and they went on to finish the season 3rd in class overall. As for the R34 it finished the season with 3 wins, tied with the Toyota Supra for most wins.<BR/><BR/>The model seen below is not from any specific race but as far as I can tell from photos seems to be closest to the Round 2-winning version of the car.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://supergt.net/archive/classic/supergt.net/jgtc/race/gallery/gall2003/032gallery.htm\">JGTC.net | 2003 PHOTO GALLERY</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.speedhunters.com/2011/03/retrospective__r34_gt_r_s_swansong_season_in_the_jgtc/\">Retrospective&gt;&gt; R34 Gt-r&apos;s Swansong Season In The Jgtc - Speedhunters</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_All_Japan_Grand_Touring_Car_Championship\">2003 All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
