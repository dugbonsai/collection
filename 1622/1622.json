Darniche/A. Mahé</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>1978 marked the official end of the works Stratos&apos; rally career. However, in 1979, Bernard Darniche proved that a privately-owned Stratos was still capable of winning events with wins in Monte Carlo &amp; Corsica and Tony Fassina winning Sanremo.<BR/><BR/>There were no wins for the Stratos in 1980 but, even in 1981, this was not quite the end. Darniche bought one of the very last factory-registered Stratos types of all - TOU62570 - and finished sixth in Monte Carlo.<BR/><BR/>Here is HPI&apos;s model of Darniche&apos;s 6th place Stratos from the 1980 Rallye Monte Carlo.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/>Rally Giants: Lancia Strartos by Graham Robson<BR/><A HREF=\"http://forum-rallye.com/index.php?/topic/972-rallye-monte-carlo-1981/?p=376907\">Rallye Monte-Carlo 1981 - Page 2 - Rallye Monte-Carlo - Forum-Rallye</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
