Barilla/S. Johansson</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8593/8593.html<BR/><BR/>There will be a quiz at the end of this post so pay attention.<BR/><BR/>The Napolex Skyline seen here participated only in the final round of the 1991 JTC season at Fuji Speedway finishing in 6th place. Although Paolo Barilla &amp; Stefan Johansson were both F1 drivers they had previous experience in the JTC. Barilla had the most experience, competing in 5 of the 6 rounds in 1989. Both Barilla &amp; Johansson raced in the biggest race of the season in 1988, 1989, &amp; 1990 which was the InterTEC 500 km at Fuji Speedway. The end of year (November) InterTEC 500 often attracted the top teams and drivers from the European and Australian championships. Top touring car drivers such as Tom Walkinshaw, Peter Brock, Allan Moffat, Allan Grice and Klaus Niedzwiedz often travelled to Fuji for the race.<BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.napolex.co.jp/english/index.html\">Napolex</A> is a Japanese auto accessories manufacturer/importer founded in 1947 as <A HREF=\"http://www.tanax.co.jp/index.html\">Tanax</A>. In 1991 the corporate name changed to Napolex and this Skyline competed in the biggest race of the JTC season as part of the public relations activities associated with the corporate re-branding. Some of the brands distributed by Napolex (<A HREF=\"http://www.napolex.co.jp/english/lineup/levoc.html\">LEVOC</A> and <A HREF=\"http://www.napolex.co.jp/english/lineup/fizz.html\">Fizz</A>) are also part of the livery.<BR/><BR/>I wasn&apos;t able to find any photos but I did find some coverage of the race on YouTube. <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/anfzdQ-u-Ro?t=20m47s\">Here you can see the car coming in for a pit stop</A> which, considering the quality of the recording, is probably the best view of the car in the entire 1+ hour video (no, I didn&apos;t watch it all). Looking at the video I see that HPI missed at least 1 logo/decoration on the car; the <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/anfzdQ-u-Ro?t=21m27s\">weird circle thingy under the NISSAN logo on the rear quarter-panel</A>.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-result.cgi?race_id=2067\">JAF: 1991 InterTEC Results</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.jaf.or.jp/CGI/msports/results/n-race/detail-driver.cgi?driver_id=214\">JAF: Driver Details: S.
