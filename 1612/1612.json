Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2015<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8326/8326.html<BR/><BR/>The 1993 JGTC season was the inaugural season of the All-<b>J</b>apan <b>G</b>rand <b>T</b>ouring Car Championship. It was the successor to the All Japan Sports Prototype Car (JSPC) Endurance Championship, as international prototypes were in a state of flux in the early 1990&apos;s, and sportscar racing globally had switched from prototypes to grand tourers.<BR/><BR/>The championship was contested over 4 rounds and was won by Masahiko Kageyama in the #2 NISMO Skyline GT-R. Kageyama won rounds 1, 2, and 4 competing against other Skylines, Silvias, and RX-7s. Round 3 was an endurance race - Suzuka 1000km - where the Nissan R92CP and other Group C cars were dominant.<BR/><BR/>This is Kageyama&apos;s winning car from Round 4, the Fuji F3000 race. It is also showing the same issues with the front and rear windows as seen on <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=303277#p302118\">8475</A>. It seems to be recurring problem with the resin models.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/><BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_JGTC_season\">1993 JGTC season - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120227074313/http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/jgtc/jgtc1993.html\">JGTC 1993</A><BR/>"}
