Comas /M. Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>1998 was the 4th - and final - season for the R33 GT-R in the JGTC series. The R33 took the GT500 Class title in its debut season in 1995 but was not able to secure a second title in 1996 or 1997 (sound like the R34 above?).<BR/><BR/>A lower center of gravity was achieved in the 1998 GT-R by positioning the engine downward and rearward. The engine was changed to a modified 1995-1996 Le Mans version with an additional 140cc of displacement. More popular with the drivers than the horsepower boost (now nearly 500hp) was the noticeable improvement of torque.<BR/><BR/>The #23 Pennzoil Nismo GT-R was driven by Érik Comas &amp; Masami Kageyama. The season got off to a great start for them with wins in rounds 1 and 3. The car seen here is from the Motegi GT Champion Race - round 5 of the series - where Comas &amp; Kageyama finished in 4th place. With top 10 finishes in all other rounds of the series, Comas &amp; Kageyama secured the second - and final - GT500 class championship for the R33 in its last season of competition.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.motorsportretro.com/2014/01/jgtc-cars/\">The eight most iconic JGTC racing machines ever - Motorsport Retro</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.nissan-motorsports.com/EN/RACE/SUPERGT2006/NISSAN/STORY/index.html\">NISSAN MOTORSPORTS | SUPER GT 2006 : Story</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://supergt.net/archive/classic/supergt.net/jgtc/ex/gtc_cham/1998/cha98_5/gtc_985.htm\">AUTOBACS CUP GT Championship 1998 Round 5</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_All_Japan_Grand_Touring_Car_Championship\">1998 All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
