Waldegård/H. Thorszelius</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2009<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/en/line_up/index_8045.php<BR/><BR/>2nd WRC win Bjorn Waldegård.<BR/>6th WRC win for Lancia.<BR/>6th WRC win for Lancia Stratos HF.<BR/><BR/>There was near-disaster for Lancia in San Remo in 1975. 3 well-prepared Stratoses were definitely faster than any of the Fiats, Opels, or Renault Alpines and Sandro Munari&apos;s 24-valve car led the rally until near halfway, then suffered a puncture and found that the wrong spare wheel had been supplied.  Rafaele Pinto&apos;s 12-valve car was doing well and set three fastest stage times before his engine became an 11-valve engine.<BR/><BR/>Fortunately, Björn Waldegård kept his 12-valve car going reliably, setting many fastest stage times, somehow driving around the problem of persistently fading brakes (even though water cooling was being tried for the first time), and never going off to win the rally.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
