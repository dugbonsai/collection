Mäkinen/H. Liddon</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>First WRC win for Timo Mäkinen<BR/>First WRC win for Ford<BR/>First WRC win for Escort RS1600<BR/><BR/>I’m more than a little surprised it took until 2019 for someone to make of model of this significant WRC winner. <BR/><BR/>For 1973, the 1,000 Lakes joined the maiden World Rally Championship as the 8th of the 13 rounds that year and attracted all the big names, keen to be the winner in the first truly global running of the rally.<BR/><BR/>Porsche sportscar hero <A HREF=\"https://scale143.com/search.php?keywords=Leo+Kinnunen\">Leo Kinnunen</A>, who’d won long-distance enduros in the firm’s Group 5 Gulf 917K, was fastest in his 911 on the first of the 43 special stages that made up the three-day event. On second stage, 1971 winner Stig Blomqvist took the lead in his Saab 94 V6 with Markku Alén in a Volvo 142 and Timo Mäkinen in a Ford Escort RS1600 scrapping over second place.<BR/><BR/>The original Stig held the lead in the distinctive three-cylinder Saab - despite the onset of heavy rain at half-distance and a roll - until stage 34 when the crankshaft broke. Mäkinen and co-driver Henry Liddon took the lead and withstood big pressure over the final eight stages from the Volvos of Alén and Hannu Mikkola as well as Kinnunen’s Porsche that set 20 fastest stage times over the event.<BR/><BR/>Mäkinen and Liddon held on to their lead to win the event giving them and Ford their first WRC victory.<BR/><BR/>If you have a spare €160,00 you can <A HREF=\"https://www.trackandperformance.com/listing/ford-escort-mk1-1973-timo-makinen-winner-of-1000-lacs/\">buy the real thing</A>.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://dirtfish.com/rally/wrc/fords-top-wrc-winners/\">Ford&apos;s top WRC winners – DirtFish</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.goodwood.com/grr/race/historic/2017/8/on-this-day-in...-1973/\">[Video] 44 years ago today, Timo Mäkinen took his maiden WRC win</A><BR/>"}
