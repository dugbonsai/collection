The racing Familia Rotary Coupe featured Type 10A engine identical to the preceding Cosmo Sport but the use of a peripheral port allowed it to generate peak power approaching the 200ps mark.<BR/>The Familia Rotary Coupe R-100 recorded its maiden victory at the Grand Prix of Singapore in April 1969 but this was just the beginning. It finished the Spa-Francorchamps 24-hour race in fifth and sixth places after four Porsche 911s, vehicles that were fundamentally in a different category. One month later, it finished in the points fifth overall in the &quot;Marathon de la Route.&quot;<BR/><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.racingsportscars.com/etcc/photo/Spa-1970-07-26.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">http://www.racingsportscars.com/etcc/photo/Spa-1970-07-26.html</A><BR/><BR/><BR/>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa_24_Hours<BR/><BR/>http://touringcarracing.net/Races/1970%20Spa.html<BR/>"}
