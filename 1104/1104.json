Warmbold/J. Todt</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2012<BR/><BR/>1973 would be the only year to see the WRC hold an event in Austria. It was also the first win for a BMW in the World Rally Championship at the hands of privateer Achim Warmbold. This model is very hard to find (only made by Troféu). I noticed that the only die cast part on this model may be the base. I had to take it apart and repair a broken wheel and the body is so light it must be plastic.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
