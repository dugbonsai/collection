Beginning with a turbocharged 2.1L 4 cylinder 4T-GTE engine (introduced in 1982) mounted onto a stock bodyshell with wide arch body kit and spoiler. Over the years, the Supra progressively underwent numerous changes; body changes being the most noticeable. By the late 1990s, the Supra used a turbocharged 2.0L 4 cylinder 3S-GT engine producing nearly 480hp. By the early 2000s, for the benefit of torque, the Supra moved on to a 4.4L V8 3UZ-FE engine.<BR/><BR/>Altogether, the Supra took the title four times in 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2005. Despite being out of production since 2002, factory teams continued to use JZA80 Supras with continued success. The car&apos;s swan song competitive year was in 2006, when it was used by Toyota Team Tsuchiya and Toyota Team SARD. After that the Supra was replaced by the Lexus SC.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
