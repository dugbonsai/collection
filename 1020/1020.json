Auriol/P. Monnet<BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2011<BR/><BR/>First Dakar win for Hubert Auriol.<BR/>2nd Dakar win for Mitsubishi.<BR/>2nd Dakar win for Pajero.<BR/><BR/>Dakar organizers TSO made significant changes to the route of the 1992 Dakar and the event finished in Cape Town, South Africa, for the first and only time in its history. The event also turned out to be the most successful to date for Mitsubishi Motors, with victory going to Frenchman Hubert Auriol who was joined on the podium by team-mates Germany&apos;s Erwin Weber – a Dakar rookie – and Shinozuka. Auriol previously won the motorcycle competition on two occasions, making him the first driver to win on both two and four wheels.<BR/><BR/>You can see it is starting to look less like a standard road-going Pajero. I assume this is based on the short wheelbases Pajero with canvas top, the top obviously replaced with a &apos;shell&apos; and wing.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
