Ikuzawa</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.ebbro.jp/SHOP/44240.html<BR/><BR/><BR/>(from <A HREF=\"http://reports.nissan-global.com/EN/?p=8647\">Start of the Skyline Legend</A>)<BR/>The 1964 Japan GP at Suzuka was the day the Skyline legend began. A team of Prince Skyline GTs lined up to challenge the established champions from abroad. The Skylines nearly didn&apos;t get to the race at all. To qualify, 100 units of the production version of the car had to be made. Prince Motor Company, later to merge with Nissan, only just made the target.<BR/><BR/>Another late addition to the field was a Porsche 904 Carrera GTS, a German car that came with a fearsome reputation. The Skyline would not defeat the Porsche but Tetsu Ikuzawa would get ahead of it in this car for a lap that all Japan would applaud. The title ultimately went to the German car, but the Skylines had a clean sweep from 2nd place to 6th.<BR/><BR/>Check out the link at the begining of the post for a great video about this.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
