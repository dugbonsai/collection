Paddon/J. Kenard</b><BR/><BR/>Only WRC win for Hayden Paddon<BR/>2nd WRC win for Hyundai<BR/>First WRC win for NG i20<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>There were 2 teams and 4 drivers racing for Hyundai in the 2016 WRC. The flagship Hyundai Motorsport (or Shell World Rally) and Hyundai Motorsport N (or Mobis World Rally) teams, both out of Germany. The driver line-up consisted of Thierry Neuville, Hayden Paddon, and Dani Sordo contesting every round (driving for both teams) and test driver Kevin Abbring contesting only 6 rounds (driving only for Hyundai Motorsport N). If that was not confusing enough, Paddon &amp; Abbring drove 2 different cars for each of the 2 different teams with Paddon and co-driver John Kenard driving the #3 &amp; #4 cars for the Shell team and the #10 &amp; #20 cars for the Mobis team.<BR/><BR/>For Rally Argentina, Paddon &amp; Kenard were entered in the #20 car for the Mobis World Rally team. After the opening 1.5km Super Special, Paddon &amp; Kenard were in 5th place. They jumped to 2nd place on SS2 and, despite two drops to 3rd on SS7 &amp; SS9, held on to their position to take advantage of a dramatic crash &amp; roll ending leader Jari-Matti Latvala’s rally in SS14. Paddon took over the lead with a comfortable 34.3s advantage over 2nd place Sébastian Ogier but it shrunk to just 2.6 seconds by the start of the final stage.<BR/><BR/>Paddon &amp; Kenard gave the performance of their career on the final stage to win it, and the rally, outright. This was Paddon’s first (and so far only) WRC win, the first win for Hyundai’s Next Gen i20, and the first WRC win for a driver (&amp; co-driver) from New Zealand. This continued Hyundai’s best-ever start in a WRC season cementing their second place in the Manufacturers’ Championship. Hyundai went on the finish the season 2nd place with Paddon securing 4th in the Drivers’ Championship.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>  <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/news/argentina-wrc-paddon-s-lead-shrinks-to-2-6s-before-power-stage-689945/?s=1&amp;r=82968&amp;em=1\">Argentina WRC: Paddon&apos;s lead shrinks to 2.6s before Power Stage</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/news/hayden-paddon-takes-rally-argentina-victory-after-stunning-power-stage-win-690063/?s=1&amp;r=82968&amp;em=1\">Hayden Paddon takes Rally Argentina victory after stunning Power Stage win</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_World_Rally_Championship\">2016 World Rally Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/times/27493-ypf-rally-argentina-2016/\">Stage times YPF Rally Argentina 2016</A><BR/>"}
