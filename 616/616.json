André/P. Puyfoulhoux</B><BR/><BR/>Marc André, a mechanic, started with a Peugeot 404 as the basis for his entry in the Dakar. He bought a wrecked Peugeot 504 and used its engine, gearbox, and front seats. Helped by an employee in his garage, he spent more than 1,000 hours getting the pick-up ready for the rally.<BR/><BR/>The bulk of the work in the passenger compartment consisted of extending it. Thus, the team had a bit of extra room behind the seats and, up above, they had a small refrigerator! The back of the pick-up was designed so that the team had a place to sleep at night. An unfortunate side-effect of lengthening the cabin was that it shortened the back causing their feet to hang off the end.<BR/><BR/>At the last stage of the rally on the beach in Dakar, Senegal organizer Thierry Sabine, who knew Mr. André, asked him to start first on the stage. Because of this the 404 arrived first at the finish line in Dakar under the flash of photographers who all believed André and Puyfoulhoux were the winners of the rally! They weren&apos;t and finished 73rd overall.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakardantan.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5416\" TARGET=\"_blank\">404 plateau n°165 André / Puyfoulhoux - Dakardantan</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipPEzzJOVPFGlnpwpd0injJYLjIEmwuGTNjUid9V\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipPEzzJOVPFGlnpwpd0injJYLjIEmwuGTNjUid9V</A><BR/>"}
