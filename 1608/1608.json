Fujimoto/A. Hertz</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2015<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8175/8175.html<BR/><BR/><BR/>For all Toyota rally enthusiasts, 1995 will go down as one of the most eventful seasons. Right from the start the new ST205 Celicas seemed to have difficluty in matching the record of the older ST185 Celicas. Interestingly, the ST185 was preferred to the ST205 on the Safari Rally.<BR/><BR/>Because the 1995 Safari Rally did not count for the championship, every leading team including Toyota sent neither their A-team drivers, nor the latest cars to compete. Instead, Toyota entrusted 2 older ST185 cars to Yoshio Fujimoto and Ian Duncan, both of these being heavily rebuilt 1994 models.<BR/><BR/>In an event where they had very little opposition, the Celicas always led. Although Duncan had to change a rear axle after his car hit rocks which seemed to have been placed in the road by vandals, he climbed back to 3rd place while Fujimoto won by a heft 42 minutes!<BR/><BR/>Toyota&apos;s 1995 season came to an unpleasant end in October when the works Celicas were found to be using illegally modified turbochargers. This resuited in Toyota&apos;s disqualification for the season and a ban from competing in 1996.<BR/><BR/>The unrestored race winning car was (and may still be) on display at the <A HREF=\"http://www.megaweb.gr.jp/area/historic/\">Mega Web History Garage</A>.
