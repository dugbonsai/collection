Peterhansel/J. P. Cottret</b><BR/><BR/>13th Dakar win for Stéphane Peterhansel<BR/>6th Dakar win for Peugeot<BR/>First Dakar win for 2008 DKR<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>In early 2014 Peugeot announced plans to return to the Dakar rally for 2015 after a 25 year hiatus (and a 5 year winning streak prior to said hiatus). The 2008 DKR - very loosely based on the 2008 crossover - was designed specifically to tackle the Dakar. Surprisingly, it was a rear-wheel-drive vehicle which allowed it to run in the two-wheel-drive buggy class. This is actually an advantage as this class is far lass restrictive than the four-wheel-drive class in which the 2012-2014 champion Mini Countryman ran. Some of the benefits include being able to run at a lower weight, being able to use larger wheels which helps with ground clearance, and being able to adjust tire pressures from inside the cockpit.<BR/><BR/>Peugeot’s results in the 2015 Dakar were not impressive (11th, 34, &amp; DNF), losing out to Mini, but they did gain some very valuable information from the event. This was used to make extensive changes to the car for the 2016 event. It was immediately clear that these changes worked as the new iteration of the 2008 DKR led the event from the first real stage through to the end of the rally. Stage 2 is generally considered the first “real stage” as the 11km Prologue was neutralized after an accident and Stage 1 was cancelled due to bad weather. Sébastien Loeb took the lead first and held on to until Stéphane Peterhansel became leader in Stage 6. Loeb was leader again after Stage 7, then back to Peterhansel after Stage 8, over to Carlos Sainz after Stage 9, and back to Peterhansel after Stage 10. Mr. Dakar held on to the lead for the rest of the event, making this his 13th Dakar win.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/dakar/2016/us/stage-900/photos-galery.html\">Photos galery : Dakar</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.redbull.com/us-en/peugeot-2008-dkr-tech-specs-and-action-images\">Peugeot 2008 DKR: Tech specs and action images +video+</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.topgear.com/car-news/motorsport/it’s-peugeot-2008-dakar-car\">It’s the Peugeot 2008 Dakar car! | Top Gear</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Dakar_Rally\">2015 Dakar Rally - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dakar_Rally\">2016 Dakar Rally - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
