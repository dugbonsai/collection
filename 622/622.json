Montcorgé/J. C. Pelletier</B><BR/><BR/>The 1981 Dakar departed from Trocadéro in Paris on January 1 and took competitors through France, Algeria, Mali, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, and finishing in Dakar, Senegal on January 20 for a total of 2,086 miles.<BR/><BR/>On a bet, Thierry de Montcorgé entered a Christian Dior sponsored Rolls Royce Corniche christened &quot;Jules&quot;, from the name of a new fragrance. Nearly 2000 hours of labor were required to transform the vehicle. The body, which only weighs 80 kg, is a polyester molding of the original one (only the doors, boot, and hood are made of aluminum) and the dashboard is the original one. As for the chassis, Montcorgé and Michel Mokrycki started from scratch to create a tubular chassis. The 4-wheel drive drivetrain consisted of two Toyota Land Cruiser axles mated to a Toyota 4-speed transmission. As for the engine, Mokrycki chose a Chevrolet 5.7L V8 rated at 350hp. After all of the modifications the Rolls tipped the scales at just 1400 kg.<BR/><BR/>Montcorgé &amp; Pelletier were one of only 40 cars (out of 170) that managed to reach the finish in Senegal but they had been disqualified earlier in the rally. Up to the mid-point of the rally they had been in 13th place but broken steering led to an accident and lengthy repairs resulting in their disqualification.<BR/><BR/>The car is presently in Paris, France and is <A HREF=\"http://www.carclassic.com/Rolls_Royce_Corniche_I_Coupe_Jules_PARIS-DAKAR_EF34.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">for sale</A> for about USD 258,000. For an additional USD 39,000 the original builder will personally upgrade the vehicle with modern axles and bigger brake discs.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.carclassic.com/Rolls_Royce_Corniche_I_Coupe_Jules_PARIS-DAKAR_EF34.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Rolls Royce Corniche | Coupe Jules PARIS-DAKAR for sale</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images205?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCKbc8N_rn8fIWw&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images205?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCKbc8N_rn8fIWw&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
