Alén/I. Kivimäki</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2012<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/en/line_up/index_8035.php<BR/><BR/>12th WRC win for Markku Alén.<BR/>23rd WRC win for Lancia.<BR/>Only WRC win for 037 Evo.<BR/><BR/>For 1984, Lancia&apos;s aim was to defend its Manufacturer&apos; Title. However, Walter Röhrl left the team to take up a seat with Audi, whose all-wheel drive Quattro was becoming increasingly competitive. Audi was absolutely determined to take Lancia&apos;s Manufacturers&apos; crown to add to the Drivers&apos; Title it had secured in 1983 with the Finn Hannu Mikkola.<BR/><BR/>The German squad achieved its aim, winning both titles in 1984, although the Lancia 037 had one final moment of glory in Corsica. Markku Alén used the nimble, rear-wheel drive machine to great effect, capturing his second straight victory on the island. The general consensus, however, was that two-wheel-drive was now far too great a technical handicap in the wake of Audi&apos;s domination with the all-wheel-drive Quattro.<BR/><BR/>This would be the last time a rear-wheel drive vehicle would win a WRC event. Lancia continued racing the 037 in the 1985 WRC season but it just could not compete with the new all-wheel drive Peugeot 205T16s and Audi Quattros.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
