Although the cars are visually related, structurally, there is no similarity between the modern GT and the 1960s GT40 that inspired it. Three production prototype cars were shown in 2003 as part of Ford&apos;s centenary, and delivery of the production Ford GT began in the fall of 2004.<BR/><BR/>Another &quot;fantasy&quot; matte black car from HPI that, like the <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=302118#p302118\">8475 NISMO GT-R LM Road Car</A>, suffers from the glazing lifting away from the body.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/>"}
