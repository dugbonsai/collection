A year later, annual sales skyrocketed to more than 6,500 cars—most of them Continental GTs. As Bentley added the GTC, Flying Spur, and Supersports variants, sales continued to soar, making the Continental GT the 92-year-old brand’s best-selling car ever in 2011. Small wonder that Bentley waited seven years before introducing this second-generation GT, and that it looked so similar to the first-generation.<BR/><BR/>The more obvious design changes to the new, $190,000 GT - a larger, more upright grille (which Minichamps seems to have captured nicely) and more pronounced rear fenders that accentuate the car’s wider stance - lend a greater element of aggressiveness to the car’s visage. “When you look at the original concept, it has a level of feminine softness to it,” says Robin Page, Bentley’s head of interior design. “We designed the new GT to have a more modern, muscular feel.”<BR/><BR/>Seamless body panels also are a distinguishing feature of the second-generation GT. Bentley creates the panels using a new technique called superforming, during which large single sheets of aluminum are heated and then shaped with air pressure.<BR/><BR/>The car’s subtly sportier look came with added brawn. The new Continental GT used the same W-12 engine and all-wheel-drive platform of its predecessor and also reached a top speed of 198 mph, but it offered more power - 567 hp versus 552 hp. The new car was also 143 pounds lighter, making its 516 ft lbs of torque all the more evident: the GT shoots to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, though it still weighs more than 5,100 pounds. The first-generation version, with 479 ft lbs of torque, accelerated from zero to 60 mph in about 4.6 seconds.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/autos-small-change-for-the-better-234325/\">Second-Generation Bentley Continental GT Luxury Sedan – Robb Report</A><BR/>"}
