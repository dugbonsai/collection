Heyer</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: https://minichamps.de/EN/Models/ModelDetails/430798552/index.html<BR/><BR/>Other than the wiper mentioned in my previous post, the fact that the livery is all decals is another clue to the age of the models. I have to say they have held up very, very well!<BR/><BR/>From <A HREF=\"http://www.fordmotorsportmodels.com/page4.htm\">fordmotorsportmodels.com</A>: The spectacular Ford Capri Turbo was unveiled at Hockenheim GP Germany July 29, 1978 - nearly two-thirds of the way through the DRM championship season. The Livery was the black and the red/yellow colours of Zakspeed&apos;s main sponsors Mampe (Mampe is a bitter-orange German liqueur). Prior to this the team was racing Ford Escorts. With only one day&apos;s testing, Heyer took pole position by 4 seconds from the championship leading BMW 320 of Harald Ertl. In the race the car was leading but only completed 5 laps, retiring with engine trouble opposite the Zakspeed/Ford hospitality box. In the remainder of the season Heyer took 3 poles and a first victory for the Capri at the Nurburgring in October.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
