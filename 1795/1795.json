It was the first car released by Bentley under Volkswagen AG management after their acquisition of Bentley in 1998 and the first ever Bentley to employ mass production manufacturing techniques. These techniques allowed it to be made in significantly larger numbers and the price was approximately half of the previous Continental R. This made the Continental GT available to a much wider and new customer base.<BR/><BR/>This first generation of the Continental GT was equipped with a 552 bhp 6.0L twin-turbo W12 and permanent four-wheel drive. Top speed was 197.6 mph with a 0-60 time of 4.8 seconds. Here is Minichamps’ version of the car in some shade of green. Minichamps says it’s Green Metallic but early 2003 models were available in Cypress &amp; Spruce.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_Continental_GT\">Bentley Continental GT - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
