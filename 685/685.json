Munari/S. Maiga</b><BR/><BR/>4th WRC win for Sandro Munari<BR/>8th WRC win for Lancia<BR/>8th WRC win for Lancia Stratos<BR/><BR/>1976 was the season in which the Stratos approached maturity, and success was chalked up in almost every nation. In the wings was Fiat’s threat to introduce a new and expensively-financed saloon (the 131 Abarth) and a disturbing tumor that Lancia, as the minor corporate partner in the Fiat Group, might soon be absorbed into the Fiat motorsport effort against its will.<BR/><BR/>No matter how much the team know, or cared, about this, they did not let it show. The season started with a full assault on the Rallye Monte Carlo where Sandro Munari, Björn Waldegård, and Rafaele Pinto had all meticulously prepared 24-valve cars.<BR/><BR/>On this occasion the Stratos completely steamrolled its competition, so much so that team boss Cesare Fiorio stage-managed a further victory for Munari. In an event which featured surprisingly little snow, and using the latest in Pirelli racing rubber, Munari’s car was fastest on 14 of the 23 timed sections, and on the pace almost everywhere else. Except for a spot of gearbox selector trouble on the final night, soon sorted out by Lancia;’s mechanics, his was a serene and seemingly unflustered performance.<BR/><BR/>Waldegård, it was widely observed, was not flat out, but drove carefully and prefessionaly to finish second. Lancia denied it at the time, but later Waldergård agreed that he had been following team orders.<BR/><BR/>No other car could keep up. The 4th placed car, Walter Röhrl’s Opel Kadett GTE, was no less than 9 minutes 22 seconds off the pace. This was the braggadocio that Fiorio had always wanted, and it was bound to impress not only the world’s media, but his bosses back home in Turin.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/>Robson, Graham. &quot;Rally Giants: Lancia Stratos&quot;<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.fondazionepirelli.org/news-ed-eventi/rally-di-montecarlo-1976-quando-un-p7-tranquillizzo-il-drago/\">Rally di Montecarlo 1976: quando un P7 tranquillizzò il Drago - Fondazione Pirelli</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
