Italian lottery organization Totip usually sponsored Jolly Club&apos;s entries but Fina was paying the bills in 1991.<BR/><BR/>Auriol &amp; Occelli led nearly all of the 31 stage rally. Miki Biasion was able to take the lead from them but only for 3 stages on the 2nd day of the 5 day event. This gave Lancia their 65th WRC win and it would be another 17 years until another manufacturer racked up more wins: Ford&apos;s 66th win came in 2008!<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.rallye-info.com/carmake_profile.asp?make=8\">Lancia Manufacturer Profile &amp; Rally History : Rallye-Info.com</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://juwra.com/sanremo_1991_stage_winners.html\">juwra.com  |  Rallies - San Remo 1991 stage winners</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://lelignard.canalblog.com/archives/2015/06/19/32239774.html\">Didier Auriol.
