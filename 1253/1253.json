The rudimentary, but strong and reliable, machine was particularly successful in the tough Safari Rally, taking four wins in six years between 1963 and 1968. Star driver at the time was Zbigniew Nowicki, the Kenyan of Polish origin mastering difficult conditions to win in 1963 and 1968.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">The African rallies have always had a reputation for the car-breaking and driver-challenging terrain on which they are held. From the very beginning of rallying in its humblest form, the gruelling African events have extracted the maximum from man and machine. In particular, the Safari Rally, the most famous of the continent&apos;s competitions, has proved to be the event that drivers and manufacturers most want to conquer. With the inherent difficulties of crossing the deserts and plains of Kenya, as well as the problems of servicing and general logistics and infrastructure, the Safari has always had a &apos;love it or loathe it&apos; appeal to competitors.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Before the creation of the WRC in 1973, the Safari shone in its own right. Indeed, the importance of all the African rallies was greater than it is now and the Safari shared its place on the calendar with the Rally of Morocco and the Ivory Coast Rally (often referred to as the Bandama Rally).</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">French manufacturer Peugeot was a keen supporter of all the African events and its commitment to and success in the tough challenges were part of its early love affair with the WRC.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"><b>FROM LITTLE ACORNS</b></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Peugeot&apos;s first successful rally car was the 404 model. Launched in 1960, the Pininfarina-designed machine featured a full-syncromesh gearbox and McPherson independent front and rear suspension. The car quickly established a reputation for robustness and reliability - ideal attributes for rallying competition.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Faced with strong competition from the likes of Volkswagen, Mercedes and DKW, Peugeot used the Safari Rally to demonstrate the 404&apos;s ability. It was a sound decision from the firm - the car taking four wins in the event - in 1963, 1966, 1967 and 1968. The key to Peugeot&apos;s successes in Africa lay in the skill of its official distributor in Nairobi. The team was able to adapt the cars to any given conditions they might face.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Peugeot&apos;s first Safari victory with the 404 - and its last - came courtesy of Zbigniew &apos;Nick&apos; Nowicki, a Kenyan of Polish origin who came home ahead of his rivals in 1963 and 1968. He gave the first hint of his skill across the treacherous terrain in 1961 when he won his class. The following year, with another 404, he took second place overall behind Tommy Fjastad&apos;s Volkswagen 1200.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Nowicki&apos;s 1963 success came after one of the toughest editions of the Safari Rally on record. Heavy rain for six weeks prior to the event flooded the roads and turned the route into a mudbath. Only seven of the 84 cars that started the Rally got to the finish. The finishers were known as the &apos;seven unsinkables&apos;, after they had managed to avoid getting bogged down in the numerous quagmires along the route. Nowicki&apos;s win was a remarkable achievement, but served only to confirm Peugeot&apos;s skill at mastering the conditions, particularly as Bert Shankland also took a similar 404 to victory in both 1966 and 1967.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"><b>REPEAT PERFORMANCE</b></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Nowicki&apos;s 1968 victory again came after only a handful of drivers made it to the finish. The entry list had included 92 competitors using cars from 20 different manufacturers, but again Nowicki came out on top. The event was almost a carbon copy of the 1963 Safari, with Nowicki putting in a dominant performance in the muddy conditions that prevailed throughout the 3,000 km (1,864 mile) event.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Local hero Joginder Singh, driving a Datsun H130, made the initial running, but he could not sustain such a strong pace in the wake of the challenge mounted by Nowicki&apos;s Peugeot 404, which claimed the fourth and final win for its French maker.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Former double winner Bert Shankland, again in a sister 404, initially held third place until he crashed into undergrowth that was obscured by floodwater. The third Peugeot 404 taking part in the event, that driven by Michael Armstrong, finished in fourth place.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">What was most noteworthy about the Peugeot 404&apos;s success in the Safari Rally was the fact that the cars were almost standard production models with minimal modifications carried out by the importer before the start of the event. The 404 certainly convinced Peugeot to continue its links with the Safari Rally when it created its successful 504, 205 Turbo 16 and 206 WRC models.</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\"></A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=272467#p272467\" TARGET=\"_blank\">   </A><BR/>"}
