Block/A. Gelsomino</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Ken Block is more widely known for his Gymkhana exploits but he has also been rallying since 2005. He started in the Rally America championship and consistently scored top 5 finishes from 2005-2009. In 2010 he started to shift his attention to the WRC and contested 7 rounds in 2010 and 8 rounds in 2011. In 2012 he became more involved in the Global Rallycross championship and his WRC participation decreased to one event (typically Mexico or Catalunya) most years.<BR/><BR/>Catalunya was the one WRC round Block contested in 2014 for M-Sport in the Ford Fiesta seen here. It was looking like a top 10 finish for Block &amp; Gelsomino but a puncture on the final stage saw them finish in 12th place.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Source:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ken_Block\">Ken Block - Wikiwand</A><BR/>"}
