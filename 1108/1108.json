Bugalski/J. P. Chiaroni</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2012 <BR/><BR/>After Citroën got bored with their Rallye Raid (i.e. Paris-Dakar) project they looked at proper rallying again. The easiest and most promising way was to copy sister company Peugeot&apos;s Formula 2 rally project. The Citroën Xsara Kit Car is very closely related to the Peugeot 306 Maxi and like the 306, the Xsara Kit Car was successful shortly after launch. In Formula 2 rallying the Xsara and the 306 seemed to be in a different league than their opposition and the Xsara even managed to win two WRC events outright! Catalunya was the first of Citroën&apos;s and Bugalski&apos;s WRC wins with the second (and last for Bugalski and the Xsara Kit Car) coming a few weeks later in the Tour de Corse.<BR/><BR/>Skid is the only manufacturer to model the winning Xsara Kit Cars and they&apos;re not too easy to find anymore. I got lucky and found this lurking on <A HREF=\"http://www.modelcars.com.au/\">Model Cars of the World</A> in Australia which has since shut down.  :(  <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/><BR/>Source: <A HREF=\"http://www.rallye-info.com/carmodel.asp?car=47\">Citroën Xsara Profile : Rallye-Info.com</A><BR/>"}
