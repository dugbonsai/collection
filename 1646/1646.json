Alén/I. Kivimäki</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Despite the new Delta S4 already having success in the 1985 &amp; 1986 seasons, Lancia chose to stick with the 037 for the 1986 Safari rally. Team boss Cesare Fiorio explained this decision as follows: &quot;We already had 2 years experience in this model in the Safari. And with the crazy calendar we have to follow during the season there was no time to develop the Delta as well for this event. So we decided to come with the old car which still, I think, is a very good car for this type of event.&quot;<BR/><BR/>Early on, Lancia struggled with overheating problems caused by long grass. During the first night section, Alén was in a determined mood as the rain started on what would be a muddy and foggy night made even worse for him with electrical problems. It became a night he&apos;d probably rather forget with an electrical system failure causing him to roll the car over on its side while driving holding a torch light out the window.<BR/><BR/>Alén was eventually the only works Lancia remaning. Vic Preston, Jr. had crashed out of the event and Miki Biasion went out when a belt failed. But Alén&apos;s problems would continue. Even his service crew manged to be in the wrong place during leg 3 as Alén was fighting for 3rd place. The service crew eventually showed up and Alén was able to take 3rd place and hold on to it to finish there.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://drag-o.blogspot.com/2011/03/campionato-mondiale-rally-1986-lancia_11.html\">MONDIALI RALLY: SAFARI RALLY 1986   -  LANCIA  RALLY 037</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/UBPnQW1xL5k\">The 1986 Safari Rally (Part 1) - YouTube</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/_aZDtpvPszQ\">The 1986 Safari Rally (Part 2) - YouTube</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/MA98Ht7MmPw\">The 1986 Safari Rally - YouTube</A><BR/>"}
