Olofsson/M. Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Kazuyoshi Hoshino &amp; Masahiko Kageyama drove the #12 Calsonic Skyline in the final year of the Group A-based JTC series. Anders Olofsson was no stranger to the JTC - having won the series championship in 1989 and 1991 - but was not a regular driver for any team that season. So what was he doing driving the #12 Calsonic Skyline in Round 3? Hoshino was injured in the F3000 Mine All Star race a week earlier so Olofsson replaced him for this one race.<BR/><BR/>Olofsson &amp; Kageyama qualified in 3rd and went on to finish the race in 2nd. Olofsson also has the distinction of being the only driver to score points in both the JTC-1 and JTC-2 classes that season as a replacement for Hoshino (JTC-1) and Takayuki Kinoshita (JTC-2). He could be the only driver to do this in any season but Iâ€™m really not interested enough to examine the statistics for every season.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10527196\"> Calsonic Skyline (#12) 1993 JTC (Diecast Car) - HobbySearch Diecast Car Store</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">1993 Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Japanese_Formula_3000_Championship\">1993 Japanese Formula 3000 Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://touringcarracing.net/Races/1993%20Sugo.html\">1993 AJTCC - round 3</A><BR/>"}
