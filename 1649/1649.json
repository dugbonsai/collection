This, in fact, was originally meant to be Björn&apos;s final drive for Toyota (he had been connected with the team for sixteen years), as he was nearing his forty-seventh birthday, and was about to turn to desert &apos;Raid&apos; rallies with Citroën.<BR/><BR/>Amazingly, this was the first occasion on which the Celica GT-Four had been used on a long-distance &apos;endurance&apos; African Rally, so victory had not been expected, but merely hoped for! Much testing, of course, had been carried out in advance (mechanic, later team manager, George Donaldson was based in a Nairobi workshop almost full-time from October 1989), but since no one really expected to win at first, against all the odds, this was a quite remarkable achievement.<BR/><BR/>Source: Rally Giants Toyota Celica GT-Four, Graham Robson<BR/>"}
