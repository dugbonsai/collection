Blomqvist/B. Cederberg</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2010<BR/><BR/>5th WRC win for Stig Blomqvist.<BR/>9th WRC win for Audi.<BR/>9th WRC win for Quattro.<BR/><BR/>For the 1982 season, Audi Sport, Audi&apos;s factory team, signed Blomqvist to drive the Quattro in a few events alongside Hannu Mikkola and Michèle Mouton. He won the Swedish Rally, finished second in the 1000 Lakes and then took his first WRC victory outside his home country by winning the Rallye Sanremo as a privateer (thus the different colors from the Audi works red/silver/black).<BR/><BR/>I think this may be the model that has been sitting around the longest without ever being photographed - slightly over 4 years now.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
