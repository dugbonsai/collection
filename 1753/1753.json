Takahashi</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The Violet seen here (and one other) was entered in the 1974 Selangor GP in Malaysia by the local Tan Chong team and competed in the race for Improved Saloons and Tourers. Their main opposition came from the team Nescafe Ford Escort driven by Harvey Yap and the ETCC-winning <A HREF=\"https://historicmotorsportcentral.com/2016/05/10/the-cologne-ga-capri/\">Cologne Ford Capri</A> driven by Paul Fahey. The Violets were driven by Kunimitsu Takahashi (The Father of Drifting) and local driver Lee Kwai Leong.<BR/><BR/>As expected, both Fords made great starts because they were quicker off the line than the turbocharged Violets. This did not last as Yapâ€™s run in the Escort ended at the very first turn in the race with suspected electrical failure. Fahey later had difficulties of his own which allowed the Violets to take lead. After a few laps the race settled into a procession led by the Violets with Fahey in the Capri in third. With just a few laps to go, the second-place Violet of Leong went out allowing Fahey to move up to second. The positions held through to the end of the race, giving Takahashi &amp; the Tan Chong team a much sought after win.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.nismo.co.jp/motorsports/entertainment/GT-R_HISTORY2017/vol3.html\">NISMO | Racing GT-R HISTORY ~ Looking back on the picture, Genealogy of hot DNA ~</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19740915-1.2.57.2\">Thrills as Datsuns, Fords battle it out at Selangor GP, The Straits Times, 15 September 1974, Page 12</A><BR/>"}
