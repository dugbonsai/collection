Blomqvist/B. Cederberg</b><BR/><BR/>11th WRC win for Stig Blomqvist<BR/>22nd WRC win for Audi<BR/>Only WRC win for Sport Quatro<BR/><BR/>The Rallye Côte d&apos;Ivoire was the penultimate round of the 1984 WRC season but counted only in the Drivers’ championship. After the previous round in Sanremo, Audi’s Stig Blomqvist held a 10 point lead over Lancia’s Markku Alén. <BR/><BR/>Both teams had declared previously that they would leave their final decisions on Ivory Coast entries until after Sanremo. Audi had always planned to take at least one car for Blomqvist, their number one driver of 1984. Alén still had a chance of beating Blomqvist to the top of the series in the two remaining rounds, but taking the team to the Ivory Coast would be a costly business, and when this was weighed against Alén’s very slim chance of becoming champion, the Italian team decided not to go.<BR/><BR/>Hannu Mikkola drove the second car for Audi - Blomqvist’s Quattro A2 used for practice - primarily as a chase car to assist Blomqvist if needed. The two Audis took the lead in the first day’s stages, Blomqvist’s Sport Quattro in front and Mikkola’s older and slightly longer Quattro A2 some five minutes behind. There was no duel between them; they were running just as planned, Mikkola close behind to help his Blomqvist if necessary. There was such a gap between the Audis and the others that third place became a prized position to avoid any dust.<BR/><BR/>Blomqvist &amp; Mikkola maintained their 1-2 positions throughout the rally with Blomqvist taking the win and the Drivers’ title for 1984. <BR/><BR/>I wasn’t able to find any photos of the car but here’s a video clip of some roadside service: <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/vc1Ha6ePDNk?t=148\">1984 RALLYE COTE D&apos;IVOIRE</A>.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Source</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1984/42/ivory-coast-rally-2\">ivory coast rally - Motor Sport Magazine</A><BR/>"}
