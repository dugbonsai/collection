On the Tour de Corse, both factory cars crashed out on their specially-developed Pirelli slick tires. Fortunately for Lancia, the semi-works Chardonnet car driven by Darniche then took up the challenge, and although the Renault Alpines challenged him to the very end, he finally won the event by just 32 seconds.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/> <BR/>"}
