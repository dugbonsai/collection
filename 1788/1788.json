Katayama/O. Noboyuki/A. Takayuki</b><BR/><BR/>The Nismo team entered the GT-R seen here in the 2000 edition of the Suzuka 1000km endurance race. The JGTC GT500 class-spec car was driven by Ukyo Katayama, Ogagi Noboyuki, &amp; Aoki Takayuki.  After the first round of qualifying, a fuel leak was found near the fuel cell forcing the team to skip the second round of qualifying. Despite this their first round times were good enough to give them an 8th place start out of 39 cars.<BR/><BR/>Takayuki was able to work his way up to 5th place but rising engine temperature forced him to pit earlier than planned. After finding the coolant leak, the car returned to the race but the leak got worse and the temperature continued to climb. After 101 laps, the car retired due to overheating.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Source</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.nismo.co.jp/M_SPORTS/2000/suzuka1000/index.html\">NISSAN MOTORSPORTS INTERNATIONAL CO.,LTD.</A><BR/>"}
