It&apos;s Maybach&apos;s and the world&apos;s most expensive car with the price of about $8 million. The 700 hp (522 kW) two-seater with a twin turbo V12 engine is a one-off design built on request for Fulda Tires. Fulda used this car as a reference vehicle to test tires. The German luxury car manufacturer created the model as a modern interpretation of its legendary streamlined sportscar from the 1930s. There are various allusions to the historical predecessor, which was likewise based on a powerful Maybach automobile.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/><BR/>Finally, my largest &amp; smallest 1:43 cars:<BR/><BR/>"}
