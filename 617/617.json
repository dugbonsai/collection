Lartigue/M. Périn</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2009<BR/><BR/>First Dakar win for Pierre Lartigue.<BR/>4th Dakar win for Citroën.<BR/>Only Dakar win for ZX Rallye Raid Evo 3.<BR/><BR/>The route for the 1994 Dakar was unusual in that it was a loop from Paris to Dakar and back to Paris. The overall distance covered was about 8,313 miles but there were only 2,763 miles of competitive racing which is less than other years. The drivers left Paris on December 28, 1993 and traveled through France, Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, back through Mauritania &amp; Morocco, Spain, and finishing at Eurodisney (!) in France on January 6, 1994.<BR/><BR/>Pierre Lartigue and Michel Périn set out in their Citroën ZX Rallye Raid. The ZX Rallye Raid looked nothing like it&apos;s production namesake which is a small family car. The ZX Rallye Raid had 4-wheel drive and a 2.5L XU15 engine developing about 330hp and 427 lb/ft of torque with a top speed of about 127 mph. For comparison, the best engine offered in the production ZX developed about 148hp and 135 lb/ft of torque.<BR/><BR/>Lartigue dominated the Dakar winning 10 of the 16 stages easily giving him his first Dakar win. This would be the first of 3 consecutive Dakar wins for Lartigue and Périn.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
