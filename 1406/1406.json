To begin with, &apos;Italia&apos; was the fourth incarnation—from no less than three different nameplates—in the production life of this machine, which despite numbering only 342 total units spanned nearly 8 years. Born in 1966 as the Griffith Series 600, just six examples of this steel-bodied 2-seater were produced before that marque went bankrupt. Several of the incomplete Griffith chassis&apos; were shipped to Ford racing gurus Holman and Moody and the car reemerged as the Omega (using Ford mechanicals in place of the Griffith&apos;s Mopar guts).<BR/><BR/>The Omega phase lasted a very short time, during which time a total of 33 cars were sold, but when Omega production ceased, Intermeccanica founders Frank and Paula Reisner decided to move production of their creation in-house. After some subtle reworking of the front fascia (which more clearly aligned it with its Italian design heritage) and the addition of a convertible version, the car was reintroduced as the Intermeccanica Torino GFX. Power train supplier Ford owned the rights to the &apos;Torino&apos; name, so the moniker was changed to &apos;Italia&apos; after the first 28 units were produced.<BR/><BR/>All Torinos and the first eight Italias used Ford&apos;s 271hp 289ci V-8, but for 1968 the new Ford 302ci/250hp V-8 took its place. Midway through 1969 the Italia got another engine, this time stepping up to the Ford 351ci/325hp V-8. All versions were backed by a 4-speed manual gearbox.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
