Katayama/Y. Terada/T. Yorino</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/><BR/>I;&apos;ve not seen pop-up headlights on a 1:43 model before so that&apos;s kind of neat. I find it a little hard to believe that Ebbro goofed on one of the driver&apos;s names. It shows &apos;K. Yorino&apos; above the window but everything I can find shows the name as &apos;<b>[color=#FF0000]T[/color]</b>. Yorino&apos;. Oops.<BR/><BR/>(from <A HREF=\"http://www.supercars.net/cars/5471.html\">supercars.net</A>)<BR/>In 1979, shortly after the RX-7 was launched in America, two racing versions with the 12A engine were entered for the Daytona 24-hour race. They qualified first and second in the GTU class, and 32nd and 34th overall. The grid was dominated by cars with large displacement engines, such as the Porsche 935, and the grueling 24-hour race started amid fears that the compact RX-7s would be overwhelmed. In fact, the RX-7s were able to showcase their fantastic handling through the course&apos;s many tight corners, and steadily worked their way up through the field. After a superb performance, the two cars crossed the finish line together, earning a one-two in the GTU class and 5th and 6th overall. This was a fantastic achievement for a first-time entrant, and it was a big surprise for the IMSA.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/><BR/>"}
