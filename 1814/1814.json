Meeke/P. Nagle</b><BR/><BR/>4th WRC win for Kris Meeke<BR/>97th WRC win for Citroën<BR/>1st WRC win for C3 WRC<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Citroën returned to full-time WRC competition in 2017 after withdrawing their works team from the 2016 season in order to focus on development of C3 WRC ahead of major regulation changes for the 2017 season. 2017 saw substantial revisions to the technical regulations aimed at improving the performance of the cars and offering teams a greater degree of technical and design freedom.<BR/><BR/>While none of Citroën’s drivers contested the entire season, Kris Meeke and Paul Nagle contested all but one (Poland) in 2 different cars over the season. The opening two rounds of 2017 proved frustrating for Meeke, crashing out in Monte Carlo and finishing 12th in Rally Sweden.<BR/><BR/>Round 3 was Mexico where Meeke took the overall lead in stage 4 and held it until the final stage (also the Power Stage where extra points were up for grabs). Meeke started the final stage with a 37.2 second lead over Sébastien Ogier and with his first victory of the season about 1 kilometer away, he slid off course on a fast right hander, ending up in a car park. Meeke &amp; Nagle were able to <A HREF=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WDwBZEOnek\">navigate their way out of the car park through a gap in a hedge</A> and saw their lead cut to lead to 13.8 seconds, still enough for them to win their first rally of 2017 and the first win for Citroën’s new C3.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Source:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://clubs1.net/2017/03/11/kris-meeke-lead-rally-mexico/\">Kris Meeke in the lead at Rally Mexico - News for Speed</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_World_Rally_Championship\">2017 World Rally Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/times/36014-rally-guanajuato-mexico-2017/\">Stage times Rally Guanajuato Mexico 2017</A><BR/>"}
