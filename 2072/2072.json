Boyce/D. Woods</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Only WRC win for Walter Boyce<BR/>First WRC win for Toyota<BR/>First WRC win for Toyota Corolla Levin (TE27)<BR/><BR/>Due to a combination of scheduling and location, the 11th round of the inaugural WRC series was not attended by most European competitors. By this point in the season, Alpine-Renault had a lead 43 points in the championship and only Fiat had a chance to beat them with 60 points still up for grabs. However, travel across the Atlantic Ocean proved to be unrealistic for most teams with only two weeks following the preceding Sanremo Rally, and even less time for a return to Europe for the following RAC Rally in England. In light of this, the works teams did not make an effort to compete in the American leg of the championship.<BR/><BR/>Toyota became the beneficiary as it was a Corolla that carried privateers Walter Boyce and Doug Woods to victory, more than 24 minutes clear of the 2nd place Volvo 142S. This undoubtedly put Toyota on the rallying map as it helped Ove Andersson convince Toyota of their potential in rallying and fund his fledgling <A HREF=\"https://www.juwra.com/tte.html\">Toyota Team Europe</A>. The rest, as they say, is history.<BR/><BR/>As for the model, I’m surprised (and pleased) that Troféu have produced a model of this very significant part of rallying history. It’s limited to 250 pieces but there seems to be good availability at the time of this post.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/>"}
