Toivonen/S. Cresto</b><BR/><BR/>This model represents probably the most well-known and infamous of the Group B accidents that spurred the ban of Group B rally cars. Toivonen &amp; Cresto won 12 of the first 17 stages of the rally and held a commanding lead when tragedy struck on stage 18. There were no witnesses to the crash itself so a definitive cause is not known but the result was the death of Toivonen &amp; Cresto. This and 3 other fatalities related to Group B cars compelled the FIA to act and Group B cars were banned for 1987. Audi was the only manufacturer to abandon Group B immediately after Corsica.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.carthrottle.com/post/wpv92r2/\">Henri Toivonen - A Corner Of Corsica That Is Forever Finish</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
