Biasion/T. Siviero</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>2nd WRC win for Massimo (Miki) Biasion<BR/>28th WRC win for Lancia<BR/>First WRC win for Delta HF 4WD<BR/><BR/>The banning of Group B at the end of the 1986 season left many manufacturers without a suitable car, with the partial exception of Lancia. The Delta HF 4WD, with its front mounted 2L turbocharged engine and four-wheel-drive, was clearly a more suitable Group A rally car than its rivals, the underpowered Mazda 323 and Ford Sierra XR4x4, the powerful but rear-drive Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and BMW M3, and the front-drive Opel Kadett GSi and Renault 11 Turbo. However, it was not without flaws. The wheels and brakes were too small and suspension travel was limited because of restrictive wheel arches. Access to key components for servicing was difficult due to the car&apos;s compact size and transverse-engined layout, the one defect that subsequent evolutions could not fully rectify. Even so, little doubt was expressed before the 1987 season began that Lancia, and one of its drivers, would win the World Championship.<BR/><BR/>In 1987, Miki Biasion, Juha Kankkunen, &amp; Bruno Saby contested the season-opening Rallye Monte Carlo. The 3 Lancias locked out the top 3 positions through stage 11. Saby retired on stage 12 and Biasion &amp; Kankkunen continued to lock out the top 2 spots for the rest of the rally. Things were looking good for Kankkunen heading into the final stage of the rally. He had taken the lead from Saby in stage 13 and 12 stages later had a 1 minute 4 second advantage over Biasion. It’s <A HREF=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1987/6/manipulated-monte\">very likely</A> that team orders were issued to ensure Biasion won the rally.<BR/><BR/>Kankkunen went on to win the Drivers’ title in 1987 but, reputedly disillusioned with team politics and the apparent favoritism shown towards Biasion, he left the team at the end of the season and rejoined Toyota for 1988.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Delta_Group_A\">Lancia Delta Group A - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/times/1576-rallye-automobile-de-monte-carlo-1987/\">Stage times Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo 1987</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://rallymania.forumfree.it/?t=33180772&amp;st=1650\">Rallye Automobile de Montecarlo - page 111 - Mondiale:il Pantheon iridato</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
