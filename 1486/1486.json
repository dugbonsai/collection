Katayama</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/><BR/>(from Japanese Nostalgic Car:)<BR/>One of the greatest rivalries from the heyday of Japanese motorsports was that of Nissan versus Mazda. After the Savanna RX-3 snatched Nissanâ€™s much anticipated 50th victory from the Skyline GT-R in December 1971, a blood feud was born. The following year that fight grew even more heated, with roaring rotaries and fierce Hakosukas duking it out throughout the 1972 season.<BR/><BR/>Katayama was expected to fight for victory in this race after winning the Japan GP earlier in the year. He qualified 3rd, breaking the 2 minute barrier for passenger cars at Fuji (along with 2 other Mazdas). He did lead the race early on but dropped out due to ignition trouble.<BR/><BR/>Here&apos;s a Mazda promotional video setting the scene for the 1972 Fuji Masters Super Touring Race, which pitted RX-2s and 3s against fearsome GT-Rs in a thrilling display of wheeled combat around the 30 degree banks of Fuji Speedway:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://japanesenostalgiccar.com/2013/01/17/1972-fuji-masters-super-touring-race/\">1972 Fuji Masters Super Touring Race</A><BR/><BR/>As for the model, the quality on this one is the worst of the 4 RX-3s - the right-front fender flare fit is not good at all.<BR/>"}
