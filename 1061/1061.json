Liatti","driver2":"F. Pons","competitionClass":"Group A","notes":"The 1997 Rallye Monte Carlo was the first rally where the all-new World Rally Car-spec cars saw competition. Subaru&apos;s WRC-spec car was the Impreza GC WRC97 (rolls of the tongue, doesn&apos;t it?) with Colin McRae as the primary driver supported by Piero Liatti, Olivier Burri, and Kenneth Eriksson. Subaru had just won it&apos;s second consecutive Constructors&apos; Championship the prior year so there were high hopes for this new car.<BR/><BR/>Liatti &amp; co-driver Fabrizia Pons (co-driver for legends Michèle Mouton &amp; Ari Vatanen) won the most stages (9) and the rally outright. Winning the new WRC-spec Subaru&apos;s inagural rally would be the high point of Liatti&apos;s career as this was his only WRC event win albeit a very auspicious win. This would also be Pons&apos; last win as a co-driver but she wound up with 4 more than Liatti.<BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/final/164-rallye-automobile-de-monte-carlo-1997/\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://www.ewrc-results.com/final/164-rallye-automobile-de-monte-carlo-1997/</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_World_Rally_Championship\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_World_Rally_Championship</A><BR/>"}
