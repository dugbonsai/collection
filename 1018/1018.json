Sainz/L. Moya</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2011<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8004/8004.html<BR/><BR/>In 1992 Toyota Team Europe prepared a massive attack on the Safari Rally, an event Toyota had already won four times in the previous decade. Three new ST185s were joined by several old-style ST165s in private hands, with major &apos;works&apos; competition coming only from Lancia, this looked like a serious effort from Toyota.<BR/><BR/>Although Lancia fought hard, this was an event almost made for Carlos Sainz to win - which he duly did, actually leading at the vast majority of time controls. The huge team was in high spirits - at one point Carlos&apos; car suffered a turbo failure, Carlos asked for a change, and the work was duly completed in just 8 minutes. In the end he defeated Juha Kankkunen&apos;s Lancia by a massive 52 minutes. This was an astonishing performance for a car (a body shell type, really) which was brand new to Africa.<BR/><BR/>I finally found some Marlboro decals on Yahoo! Japan to finish the livery on this one. Unfortunately the bonnet decal didn&apos;t conform to the curves too well but you can only notice it in the photos.<BR/><BR/>10th WRC win for Carlos Sainz.<BR/>23rd WRC win for Toyota.<BR/>First WRC win for ST185.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
