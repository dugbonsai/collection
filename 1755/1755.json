Eklund/J. Johansson</b><BR/><BR/>Per Eklund and Johnny Johansson drove this Subaru Legacy (with probably one of the busiest liveries Iâ€™ve seen on a rally car) for Clarion Team Europe in the 1992 Swedish Rally. Eklund &amp; Johansson ran into trouble early on when the car lost boost from the turbocharger due to a loose clip on one of the pipes on SS3. Because of this they found themselves in 21st place overall. By the end of the first day they fought their way back up to 7th place. Midway through the 2nd day on SS20, 6th place Lasse Lampi &amp; Pentti Kuukkala  went off the road and lost 7 minutes allowing Eklund &amp; Johansson to move up to 6th. They held this position and went on to finish the rally in 6th place.<BR/><BR/>Here is a <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/YFHD25qoZHg?t=15m26s\">short clip</A> of Eklund &amp; Johansson in action on the snow-covered forest stages.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1992/17/great-scot\">Great scot | Motor Sport Magazine Archive</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/results/626-international-swedish-rally-1992/\">Stage results International Swedish Rally 1992</A><BR/>"}
