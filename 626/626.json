Pons</B><BR/><BR/>The 2003 Dakar departed from the coastal city of Marseille, France on January 1 and took competitors through France, Spain, Tunisia, Libya and finishing in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on January 19 for a total of 3,241 miles. This was only the 2nd time the rally finished in Egypt instead of Dakar, Senegal. <BR/><BR/>2003 marked the return of Volkwagen to the Dakar after their victory 13 years earlier. They returned with 5 vehicles and the goal of beating their Japanese rivals at Mitsubishi. Volkswagen even had former Mitsubishi driver and 2001 Dakar winner Jutta Kleinschmidt on the team.<BR/><BR/>Launched at the 2002 Essen Motor Show, the Tarek was inspired by Volkswagen&apos;s W12 supercar concepts and the Touareg off-roader. It was equipped with a 1.9L 218hp TDI diesel engine generating around 288 ft-lb of torque. Tipping the scales at just over 2,600 lbs. this was plenty of power for outrunning the more powerful gasoline-engined competitors. The rear-wheel drive buggy was based on a light-weight tubular frame covered by carbon-fiber bodywork designed by ItalDesign - Giugiaro S.p.A.<BR/><BR/>Kleinschmidt ultimately finished in 8th place with no stage wins.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Dakar_Rally\" TARGET=\"_blank\">2003 Dakar - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1531/Volkswagen-Tarek.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">2003 Volkswagen Tarek - Images, Specifications and Information</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.supercars.net/cars/2276.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Volkswagen Tarek - Supercars.net</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images529?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCPPwwcuupOureQ&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images529?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCPPwwcuupOureQ&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
