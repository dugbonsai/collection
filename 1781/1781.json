Alén/I. Kivimäki</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Hannu Mikkola &amp; Stig Blomqvist dominated the 1983 1,000 Lakes Rally in their Audi Quattro A2s, jointly winning 42 of the 50 stages and leading for 41 of the 50 stages. Markku Alén in the Lancia 037 seen here led for the other 9 stages and was always a little too close for comfort. At the time there were 4 championship rounds left to contest and Blomqvist was leading the Drivers’ Championship with Mikkola 2 points behind him. However, Blomqvist was not contesting all 4 of those rounds but Mikkola was. Audi calculated that Mikkola had a very good chance of being champion and they wanted him to win in Finland.<BR/><BR/>Audi had two problems though. The first problem was that Blomqvist was leading the rally so team orders forced him to slow down on the final 2 stages. The second problem was that Alén was about 30 seconds behind in 3rd place ready to capitalize on a mistake by either Audi driver. Fortunately for Audi, their plan worked and Mikkola won the rally (and the Drivers’ Championship). Alén held on to finish in 3rd place.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/worldrallyarchive/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=904473779611006\">World Rally Archive. 1973-1993 - Photos</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/eventstats/10037-rally-of-the-1000-lakes-1983/\">Stats Rally of the 1000 Lakes 1983</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_World_Rally_Championship\">1983 World Rally Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-1983/29/rally-review\">Rally Review | Motor Sport Magazine Archive</A><BR/>"}
