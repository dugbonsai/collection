Suzuki (1:43)</B><BR/>For 2010 the Hino team put up a good fight in the Truck classification in which there were 52 entrants altogether, competing well with heavy-duty trucks in the Modified Truck classification. Mid-way through the rally Sugawara took the lead in the Under 10 Liters Challenge which also put him in the lead of the Production Truck classification (which has no engine displacement requirements). He finished in 7th overall in the Truck classification and won double victories in the Production Truck classification with a margin of just over 6 hours (6:09:29) and Under 10 Liters Challenge with a margin of over 17 hours (17:23:29).<BR/><BR/>At 58 years of age the 2010 Dakar was Sugawara&apos;s 26th entry in the Dakar (a record) and his 19th consecutive Dakar finish (another record). This made his finish percentage 94% (16 finishes out of 17 entries). He is also the only Japanese racer to have raced in all categories (bike, quad, car, and truck).<BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Click thumbnails below for larger images.<BR/>  <BR/><BR/>  <BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOlt22mFhG33oAap_dlZgKLoL3FICwITHgwaclh\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOlt22mFhG33oAap_dlZgKLoL3FICwITHgwaclh</A><BR/>"}
