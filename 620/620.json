Cottret</B><BR/><BR/>The 22nd edition of the Dakar offered a considerable surprise: for the first time the rally crossed Africa from west to east, from Senegal toward Egypt. Starting January 6 in Dakar, Senegal the rally continued through Mail, Burkina Faso, Niger, Libya, and finished at the foot of the pyramids in Egypt on January 23 for a total of 3,114 competitive miles. However, upon arrival in Niger, the rally received threats of a terrorist attack and the organizers decided to suspend the race at Niamey for 5 days. The decision was then made to organize a huge airlift between Niamey, Niger and Sabha, Libya, using Antonov 124 transport planes to transport the entire rally - people and machines!<BR/><BR/>Aixam was a French automobile manufacturer founded in 1983 to make microcars. 10 years after the creation of Aixam the company became Aixam-Mega with the creation of a range of standard sized cars under the Mega brand. 2000 was Mega&apos;s first participation in the Dakar rally with the Mega Désert.<BR/><BR/>After winning the Dakar 6 times on a motorcycle, this was Peterhansel&apos;s second outing in a 4-wheeled vehicle and it was quite successful. Even though they only won 2 stages, Peterhansel and Cottret finished in a remarkable second place!<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.mega-vehicles.com/en-company-history.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Mega, Company History</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aixam\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Aixam Wikipedia Entry</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Dakar_Rally\" TARGET=\"_blank\">2000 Dakar Rally Wikipedia Entry</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephane_Peterhansel\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Stéphane Peterhansel Wikipdeia Entry</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images528?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCOH6wM7005i3PQ&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images528?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCOH6wM7005i3PQ&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
