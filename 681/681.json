The brush guard and snorkel really look the part and the small lights (?) in the rearview mirrors are easy to overlook but a nice detail. While the snorkel is flexible I don&apos;t know how much flexing it can take so I didn&apos;t try to pry the bonnet open to take photos of the engine. It&apos;s on par with other AUTOart releases of the time.<BR/><BR/>1999 was the last year that Totoya produced any WRC Corollas (15 total) and Sainz drove this one to a 3rd place finish in the rally. <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.rallycars.com/Cars/Toyota_GT4/Celica5.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">The Toyota Celica GT4 part 5</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOsLC9zmKz8nbhEw70uIl9vSY0huzNiKk4B8H-W\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOsLC9zmKz8nbhEw70uIl9vSY0huzNiKk4B8H-W</A><BR/>"}
