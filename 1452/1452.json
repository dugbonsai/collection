Ludwig</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: https://minichamps.de/EN/Models/ModelDetails/430808501/index.html<BR/><BR/>From <A HREF=\"http://www.fordmotorsportmodels.com/page4.htm\">fordmotorsportmodels.com</A>: In 1980, Klaus Ludwig joined the Ford team to drive in Division 1. Ludwig finished on the podium at the first two races and won the next two rounds at Hockenhiem and the Nürburgring. However a protest was lodged over the Division 1 Capri&apos;s new larger rear wing. The width of the structure  was slightly greater than the wheel arches and the design was eventually outlawed by the race authorities. Ludwig was stripped of the points gained from the two opening rounds at Zolder and the Nürburgring.  Ground effect tunnel and side skirts were introduced to compensate and 5 more Division 1 victories followed. This was enough to give Ludwig the Division 1 title, but the deducted points relegated him to third in the overall championship.<BR/><BR/>I will assume the rear wing was changed back to pre-1980 configuration since this looks exactly the same as the previous 1978 &amp; 1979 cars and not as seen here:<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
