Montcorgé/J. P. Nicolle</B><BR/><BR/>The 1984 Dakar departed from Place de la Concorde in Paris on January 1 and took competitors through France, Algeria, Niger, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and finishing in Dakar, Senegal on January 20 for a total of 3,655 miles. There was no rest day so it was 20 straight days of driving!<BR/><BR/>The Jules II Proto - sponsored by the namesake Christian Dior perfume - was a 6-wheeled 4-wheel drive vehicle designed by the driver, Thierry de Montcorgé. The drivetrain consisted of a mid-mounted Chevrolet 5.7L engine developing 391 lb-ft of torque and 360hp mated to a Porsche 935 transmisson. This combination was good for a top speed of nearly 120 mph on the track. In addition, the vehicle was equipped with a special generator that allowed the use of welding and electrical equipment.<BR/><BR/>Montcorgé &amp; Nicolle were a DNF having to withdraw due to a broken chassis.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.oto6.free.fr/6roues/berlineparisdakar.htm\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Berlines à 6 Roues : Paris Dakar (6 Wheel Sedans: Paris Dakar)</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://karakullake.blogspot.com/2009/11/jules-proto-6x4-dakar-racer.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Tamerlane&apos;s Thoughts: Jules Proto 6x4 Dakar Racer</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images206?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCI3l7L7qzc71jAE&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images206?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCI3l7L7qzc71jAE&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
