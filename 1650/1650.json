Sainz/L. Moya</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8089/8089.html<BR/><BR/>5th WRC win for Carlos Sainz<BR/>16th WRC win for Toyota (1st Rallye Monte Carlo win)<BR/>7th WRC win for Celica GT-Four (ST165)<BR/><BR/>The model is another fine effort from HPI but it is missing the Marlboro decals. <BR/><BR/>Even though the second-generation Celica GT-Four (ST185) was being marketed throughout 1991, TTE carried on using the existing &apos;old&apos; (ST165) type car throughout the 1991 season. By this time it was thoroughly proven and a rally winner in alomst every circumstance.<BR/><BR/>For Toyota  and Carlos Sainz the 1991 season started well, with an unexpected victory in the Rallye Monte Carlo. Such a win was fervently desired of couse - Toyota had never won this event before - but even on the final night Sainz had seemed to be well beaten by Ford debutant François Delecour&apos;s Sierra Cosworth 4x4. Until, that is, the Ford suffered a broken suspension joint on the very last special stage, which relegated him to third place at the finish in total despair.<BR/><BR/>For Toyota a win was a win, gleefully accepted, especially as it had been longing for Monte Carlo success since Ove Andersson himself had begiun driving Toyotas in the 1970s.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/>Rally Giants: Toyota Celica GT-Four by Graham Robson<BR/><A HREF=\"https://twitter.com/tmgofficial/status/690113037865480192\">Toyota Motorsport on Twitter: &quot;Let’s rewind 25 years to 1991 for today’s #tbt, our first @OfficialWRC Rallye Monte-Carlo win with Carlos #Sainz! https://t.co/pk9p7JhQsQ&quot;</A> (image)<BR/>"}
