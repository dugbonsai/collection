Solberg/P. Mills</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>2005 was the second year for Rally Japan in the WRC. Petter Solberg &amp; Phil Mills gave Subaru a win in their home event on the inaugural event in 2004. Things were looking good for a repeat in 2005 with Solberg leading 2nd place Marcus Grönholm by a little over 22 seconds with 2 stages to go. Unfortunately, a crash on SS25 put an end to any hopes of a second victory for Subaru in Japan. Instead, Marcus Grönholm was able to capitalize on Solberg’s misfortune and take his second win of the season. Solberg’s crash ultimately benefited season champion Sébastien Loeb who finished a record 56 points ahead of Solberg &amp; Grönholm.<BR/><BR/>This is HPI’s version of the car and one of the first 4 models produced by HPI. All four of their first models were Subaru Imprezas as seen here in this <A HREF=\"http://www.hpiracing.com/en/article/view/2006011601\">January 17, 2006 announcement</A>. Almost 12 years later, this model still looks just as good or better than many current releases.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://citroen.rallye-info.com/galleryphoto.asp?sid=1&amp;mediaid=2618\">Photo: 2005 WRC Rally Japan, Petter Solberg - Phil Mills - Subaru Impreza (44S) WRC05 : Rallye-Info.com</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_Japan\">Rally Japan - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/results/45-rally-japan-2005/\">Stage results Rally Japan 2005</A><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_World_Rally_Championship\">2005 World Rally Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
