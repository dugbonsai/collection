Preston, Jr./J. Lyall</b><BR/><BR/>Despite debuting in 1982, Lancia did not enter its new 037 in the Safari rally until 2 years later in 1984. The Safari rally was the one rally that was never conquered by the Stratos so Lancia had high hopes for the 037. Lancia entered 2 cars in the event. The <A HREF=\"<BR/>https://scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=372987#p372987\">#7 car was driven by Markku Alén</A> and they enlisted the services of local Safari rally veteran Vic Preston, Jr. specifically for the event in the #17 car.<BR/><BR/>Despite their efforts, Lancia would have to wait for their first Safari win. Alén finished in 4th and Preston finished in 6th. You can see one of the cars in action in this YouTube clip: https://youtu.be/49aOEWppe0c?t=5m13s<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/>"}
