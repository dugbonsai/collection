Liatti/A. Allesandrini</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The Subaru Impreza 555 debuted in round 9 of the 1993 WRC Champtionship in Finland. However, many of the 11 (!) Subaru team drivers were still driving the previous-generation Legacy RS rally cars. Piero Liatti was one of those drivers, and the only team driver entered in round 11, the Rallye Sanremo.<BR/><BR/>Liatti &amp; co-driver Alessandro Allessandrini drove their Legacy to 4th place overall, winning 8 stages along the way. This would be the best result for the previous-generation Legacy RS after it was replaced by the Impreza 555. Not a bad result considering something major must have happened along the way based on the photo above.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/worldrallyarchive/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1136269579764757\">World Rally Archive - 1993 35th Rallye Sanremo</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_World_Rally_Team#1993\">Subaru World Rally Team - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Rally_Championship\">1993 World Rally Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/final/538-rallye-sanremo-rallye-ditalia-1993/\">Final results Rallye Sanremo - Rallye d&apos;Italia 1993</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.rallye-info.com/carmodel.asp?car=64\">SubaruÂ Legacy Profile : Rallye-Info.com</A><BR/>"}
