Darniche/A. Mahé</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Even though the factory-backed career of the Stratos ended in 1978 they continued to be rallied by privateers. Even in 1981 it was not quite the end. Bernard Darniche bought one of the very last factory registered Stratos types of all - TOU62570 - and raced it in WRC and ERC events. Darniche drove this Stratos to a 2nd place finish in the 1981 ERC Tour de France Automobile.<BR/><BR/>This model was posted previously but back in 2017 (didn’t seem like that long ago) I bought one that has the Gitanes decals and sold the censored version. If you look really close you will see the Gitanes logo on the rally plates on the bonnet and rear deckled.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.ewrc-results.com/profile.php?p=11966&amp;t=Bernard-Darniche\">Bernard Darniche -  eWRC-results.com</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.slotforum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=75551\">Teamslot News; Lancia Stratos - News - SlotForum</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
