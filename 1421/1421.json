Nikolaev/S. Savostin/V. Rybakov (1 of 3500)</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2013<BR/><BR/>First Dakar win for Eduard Nikolaev.<BR/>12th Dakar win for Kamaz.<BR/><BR/>Kamaz continued their domination of the Dakar after Iveco took the win in 2012. With this win Kamaz would have double the 6 wins of closest rival Tatra.<BR/><BR/>I don&apos;t know whey these aren&apos;t more easily available. First of all, Eligor doesn&apos;t mention these anywhere on their site. Secondly, they&apos;re typically only available from Russian on-line shops. They do occasionally show up on eBay but they are terribly over-priced. Finally, the few Russian on-line shops I have found don&apos;t accept what most would consider the usual forms of payment. To wit, I had to use Western Union to purchase this.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
