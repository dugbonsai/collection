Liatti/F. Pons</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8574/8574.html<BR/><BR/>Only WRC win for Piero Liatti<BR/>13th WRC win for Subaru<BR/>First WRC win for Impreza GC WRC97<BR/><BR/>The 1997 Rallye Monte Carlo was the first rally for Subaru&apos;s new WRC-spec car - the Impreza GC WRC97. Colin McRae was the primary driver and was supported by Piero Liatti, Olivier Burri, and Kenneth Eriksson. Subaru had just won it&apos;s second consecutive Constructors&apos; Championship the prior year so there were high hopes for this new car.<BR/><BR/>Two of the new Imprezas were entered in the rally with Piero Liatti &amp; Fabrizia Pons (co-driver for legends Michèle Mouton &amp; Ari Vatanen) supporting McRae &amp; Nicky Grist. Mc Rae &amp; Liatti swapped 3rd &amp; 4th positions through the first 6 stages of the rally until McRae crashed out on stage 7. Liatti finally took the lead during stage 13 and kept it until the end, winning the most stages of any driver (9) and the rally outright. Winning the new WRC-spec Subaru&apos;s inagural rally would be the high point of Liatti&apos;s career as this was his only WRC win.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_World_Rally_Team\">Subaru World Rally Team - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.juwra.com/monte_carlo_1997_stage_winners.html\">juwra.com  |  Rallies - Monte Carlo 1997 stage winners</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.ewrc-results.com/times.php?e=164&amp;t=Rallye-Automobile-de-Monte-Carlo-1997\">eWRC-results.com - rally database</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.ewrc.cz/ewrc/image_browse.php?id=16173\">eWRC.cz - po všech stránkách rally…</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
