Alén/I. Kivimäki</b><BR/><BR/>Despite debuting in 1982, Lancia did not enter its new 037 in the Safari rally until 2 years later in 1984. The Safari rally was the one rally that was never conquered by the Stratos so Lancia had high hopes for the 037. Lancia entered 2 cars in the event. The #7 car was driven by Markku Alén and they enlisted the services of local Safari rally veteran <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=339386#p339386\">Vic Preston, Jr. specifically for the event in the #17 car</A>.<BR/><BR/>Despite their efforts, Lancia would have to wait for their first Safari win. Alén finished in 4th, 1 hour and 6 minutes down on winner <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=342233#p342233\">Björn Waldegård</A>.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/worldrallyarchive/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=910560719002312\">World Rally Archive. 1973-1993 - 1984 32nd Marlboro Safari Rally</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
