Their Pajero was a T1 (or Production Cross-Country Car) class entry. I can&apos;t find any information about them finishing the rally so I assume they were a DNF. Even Mitsubishi&apos;s Motor Sports site doesn&apos;t mention anything about them after stage 8 when they were in 20th place overall.<BR/><BR/><BR/>Sources<BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/motorsports/99dakar/rallycar.html#T1Pajero\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Mitsubishi Motors/1999 Granada-Dakar Rally/Rally Cars</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/motorsports/history/1999.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Mitsubishi Motors/1999 Granada - Dakar</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/motorsports/99dakar/communique8.html\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Mitsubishi Motors/1999 Granada-Dakar Rally/Daily Communique - Stage 8</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipP1TT09dCOiZN7XShfQt7PDNXqJR40azkLvUftz\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipP1TT09dCOiZN7XShfQt7PDNXqJR40azkLvUftz</A><BR/>"}
