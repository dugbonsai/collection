Kankkunen/J. Piironen</b><BR/><BR/>16th WRC win for Juha Kankkunen<BR/>20th WRC win for Toyota<BR/>7th WRC win for Celica GT-Four (ST185)<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>It’s scary how fast 8 years can pass so quickly. I bought this model July 11, 2010. I applied the Marlboro decals and photographed the model June 24, 2017 and it’s finally appearing here in it’s uncensored splendor 1 year (+1 day) after that.<BR/><BR/>Toyota Team Europa (TTE) had been testing and developing in Kenya for months before this Easter classic, and entered no fewer than three brand-new Celicas, to be driven by Juha Kankkunen, Markku Alén, and Ian Duncan, with Yasuhiro Iwase driving an ex-Acropolis car from 1992.<BR/><BR/>Although Toyota was the only top team that opted to take part (Ford and Mitsubishi stayed at home, and Carlos Sainz&apos;s small Lancia team could not justify the funds), it was as serious as ever, setting its stamp on the event from the early hours, and absolutely dominated the results. Though Ian Duncan&apos;s car was delayed when it hit an animal, no other marque ever headed the event, and Kankkunen led the whole way. In the end, the two Flying Finns - Kankkunen and Alén - were way out in front.<BR/><BR/>To quote Juha: &quot;The Safari is never an easy event to win, but sometimes when everything goes well it feels easy. This time everything worked really well...&quot;<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/worldrallyarchive/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1110139242377791\">World Rally Archive. 1973-1993 - Photos - 1993 41st Safari Rally</A> (photo)<BR/>Rally Giants: Toyota Celica GT-Four, Graham Robson<BR/>"}
