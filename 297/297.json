Munari/M. Maiga</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2009<BR/>Manufacturer Page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/en/line_up/index_980.php<BR/><BR/>7th (and last) WRC win for Sandro Munari.<BR/>12th WRC win for Lancia.<BR/>12th WRC win for Lancia Stratos HF.<BR/><BR/>You could say that Lancia and Sandro Munari were the Citroën and Sébastien Loeb of their time. Lancia&apos;s 12 WRC wins with the Stratos was almost double their nearest rival Renault and Munari&apos;s 7 WRC wins were more than any other driver at the time.<BR/><BR/>(from Rally Giants: Lancia Stratos, Graham Robson)<BR/>In the first event of the 1977 season, Monte Carlo, Sandro Munari won this world famous rally for the third time in a Lancia Stratos. Monte Carlo, of course, was an event almost tailor-made for the Stratos, with lots of ice and snow to test traction and handling, and with much time available for dedicates drivers like Munari to practice.<BR/><BR/>The result, which was forecast weeks in advance, was that Munari&apos;s 24-valve car won narrowly: although he was fastest on six of the stages, second or third fastest on eleven more, he had obscure engine electrical problems which dropped him well back on two stages near the end of the event.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
