Shinozuka/J. Meadows</b><BR/><BR/>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation sought to improve its image through the established path of participation in motorsport. The Lancer 1600 GSR and Pajero/Montero/Shogun both achieved great success in rallying and Rally Raid events, and eventually the company planned an attempt on the Group B class of the World Rally Championship with a four-wheel drive version of its Starion coupé. However, the class was outlawed following several fatal accidents in 1985 and 1986, and Mitsubishi was forced to reassess its approach. It instead homologated the recently introduced sixth generation of its Galant sedan for the Group A class, using the mechanical underpinnings from its aborted Starion prototype.<BR/><BR/>This is IXO&apos;s model of the 1991 Rallye Côte d&apos;Ivoire Bandama winner driven by Kenjiro Shinozuka &amp; John Meadows. It was Shinozuka&apos;s first WRC win, Mitsubishi&apos;s 3rd WRC win, and the 1st win for the Galant VR-4.<BR/><BR/>As for the model there are a lot of small details bits but the white paint is not so great.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
