C. Andruet/M. Rick</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8198/8198.html<BR/><BR/>After barely winning the WRC Manufacturers&apos; title in 1983 (beating Audi by 2 points) Lancia introduced the 037 Evo to help defend their title. Even with improved engine power the rear-wheel drive 037 was not able to handle the 4WD competition from Audi (Quattro) &amp; Peugeot (205 T16). In fact, Lancia only had one win in 1984 at the Tour de Corse at the hands of works driver Markku Al√©n. This is Jean-Claude Andruet&apos;s car that finished in 6th place.<BR/><BR/>The car makes a brief appearance in this <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/PnurjLMIkKg?t=4m58s\">1984 Tour De Corse video</A> which includes some great footage of Audis, Peugeots, Renaults, &amp; Opels.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Rally_037\">Lancia Rally 037 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A><BR/>"}
