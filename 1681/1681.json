Hasemi/A. Olofsson</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>In 1990 the GT-R name returned to racing after a 16 year absence. Two Skyline R32 GT-Rs were entered in Round 1 of the 1990 Japanese Touring Car Championship, the All-Japan Touring Car 300km. The #12 Calsonic car was driven by Kazuyoshi Hoshino and Toshio Suzuki and the #1 Reebok car was driven by Masahiro Hasemi &amp; Anders Olofsson. Hoshino/Suzuki took the pole position and Hasemi/Olofsson qualified in 2nd place. Godzillaâ€™s domination of the competition became apparent early on as the 2 Skylines had lapped all other competitors just a quarter of the way through the race. The 2 Skylines went on to finish the race in the same order as they started.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Spurces</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://i-love-skyline.com/177\">Calsonic GT - R race backstory, history!
