In Newman&apos;s case, he was selling Nissan Skylines. The fact that Newman raced for Nissan during the late &apos;70s and early &apos;80s helped with his appeal. There was even a special R30 version named the Paul Newman Version which was a top spec GT-ES turbo with signature embroidery and decals.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>What we have here from P-4, is the DR30 seen in one of Newman&apos;s commercials: <BR/>https://youtu.be/M6M2X6IhIqo?t=2m4s<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://petrolicious.com/articles/nissan-couldn-t-have-sold-the-skyline-without-paul-newman\">Nissan Couldn’t Have Sold The Skyline Without Paul Newman •  Petrolicious</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Skyline#R30\">Nissan Skyline - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.cars-on-line.com/57400.html\">1984 Nissan R30 Skyline</A> (photo)<BR/>"}
