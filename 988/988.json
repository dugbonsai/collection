Hirvonen/J. Lehtinen</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2011<BR/><BR/>7th WRC win for Mikko Hirvonen.<BR/>68th WRC win for Ford.<BR/>Only WRC win for Ford Focus RS WRC 08.<BR/><BR/>Ford&apos;s least successful Focus-based rally car. This was the 2nd evolution of the new-shape Focus originally introduced in form of the Focus RS WRC 06 in Rally Australia 2005. As with evolutions, changes remained small. Aesthetic changes in front grille were related to slightly changed looks of the base car - interestingly these changes for the rally car were achieved by taping the headlights and painting the area above the air intake grille. The car was also reported to have a new crankshaft and turbo in a quest to increase range of available power.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
