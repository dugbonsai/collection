Auriol/B. Occelli</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/en/line_up/index_8040.php<BR/><BR/>8th WRC win for Didier Auriol.<BR/>68th WRC win for Lancia.<BR/>3rd WRC win for Delta Evo.<BR/><BR/>This fourth and final evolution of the Delta, with its stiffer body, wider wheel arches, bigger wheels and brakes, improved suspension and aerodynamics and more powerful engine, was 5-6% faster under most circumstances than the 16v car. However, it represented the most that could be extracted from a design that was fundamentally outdated and, with no successor planned, Lancia officially withdrew from rallying at the end of 1991. For the next two seasons the cars would be run by the semi-private Jolly Club team, albeit initially with continuing support from the factory.<BR/><BR/>For 1992 Toyota had an all-new Celica, in contrast to Lancia’s updated Delta, leading to renewed speculation that Lancia would be outclassed. In fact the Celica initially proved problematic and Auriol dominated the early part of the season for Lancia, taking a record six wins and pulling out a large championship lead. This was win #2 of the 6.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
