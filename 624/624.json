Jacky was well-known as a four-time winner of the Le Mans 24 hour Grand Prix and Claude was not quite as well-known formerly racing go-karts.<BR/><BR/>In their first outing they claimed a win in stage 11 after suffering suspension problems in stage 5. This was the high-point of their rally as they had to retire in the next stage after a spectacular roll-over.<BR/><BR/><U>Sources</U><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/docs/histo_1979_2007_us.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">History of Dakar - RETROSPECTIVE 1979-2007</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images203?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCPTYj92ox8-AhAE&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images203?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCPTYj92ox8-AhAE&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
