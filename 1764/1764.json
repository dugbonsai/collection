It was designed from the ground-up as a purpose-built, mid-engined rally supercar. The 200 homologation road-legal models were essentially a by-product of Ford wanting to race the RS200 and show off their technology capabilities in the World Rally Championship.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_RS200\">Ford RS200 - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
