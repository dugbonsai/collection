Solberg/P. Mills (#20 of 1499)</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2010<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.sunstarmodelcars.com/43241/43241.htm<BR/><BR/>(from <A HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petter_Solberg#2009\">Wikipedia</A>)<BR/>After Subaru&apos;s withdrawal from the WRC in late 2008, Solberg officially unveiled the Petter Solberg World Rally Team in early 2009, with himself as driver and Phil Mills as co-driver. It took some time to adapt to the new car during their first round in Norway, but eventually Petter and Phil managed to secure a sixth place and three points in the drivers&apos; championship. Following that result and a new engine from Citroën, Solberg finished third in the Cyprus Rally, being the first true privateer in a privately run team to be in the podium since Malcolm Wilson back in 1993.<BR/><BR/>The model is what you would expect from Vitesse. This is looks a little worse than the average Vitesse since it broke free from the base during shipping causing some damage to decals. The bonnet opens which, IMO, is a complete waste of time. Fortunately the livery helps camouflage the huge gaps around the bonnet.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
