Block/A. Gelsomino</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://ixomodels.com/index.php/car/popup/1915<BR/><BR/>Likely known more for his Gymkhana antics, Block got started in motorsports in 2005 in the Rally America series winning the Rookie of the Year award that year. He then dabbled in WRC events starting 2007 culminating with a 7th place finish in Mexico in 2013. Since then he has not competed in the WRC, instead focusing on Global Rallycross.<BR/><BR/>The model is a pretty solid effort from IXO. The only issue I noticed was the peeling/lifting Ford logo on the back.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>  <BR/>"}
