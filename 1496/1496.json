Comas/S. Motoyama</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.ebbro.jp/SHOP/43066.html<BR/><BR/>After ending a disappointing Formula One career at the end of the 1994 season, Érik Comas went to Japan to continue his racing career in the All-Japan Grand Touring Car Championship (JGTC), Japan&apos;s premiere racing series. Soon enough, he won the GT500 title in 1998 and 1999 for Nissan in a factory Nismo-prepared Skyline GT-R. By the end of the 2003 season, he was the most successful driver in the history of the series, with the most career championship points ever scored by a single driver. This was eventually surpassed by another Nismo driver, and co-drover, Satoshi Motoyama.<BR/><BR/>This is a very early release from Ebbro based on the item number and the label on the box says ©1999. If that&apos;s when it was released it looks pretty good for 15 years old.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
