Ogier/J. Ingrassia</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The second generation of the Polo R WRC was put into development in early 2014, with the help of former World Champion Marcus Grönholm, in anticipation of a 2015 debut at Monte Carlo. Ongoing development plans were intended to take the second generation car through to the next revision of the technical regulations in 2017. Volkswagen’s primary manufacturer team (Volkswagen Motorsport) driver line-up remained the same: Sebastian Ogier/Julien Ingrassia and Jari-Marri Latvala &amp; Mikka Anttila.<BR/><BR/>Nine-time World Champion Sébastien Loeb returned to the WRC to contest the Monte Carlo for Citroën and took the lead right from the start. Ogier was able to finally overtake Loeb for the rally lead on stage 7, with team-mates Latvala in 2nd and Mikkelsen - driving for VW’s second works team (Volkswagen Motorsport II) - in 3rd. The top 3 stayed like this through the rest of the event with VW sweeping the podium.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.wrc.com/en/wrc/news/january-2015/monte-leg-2-wrc/page/2103--12-12-.html\">Ogier takes charge in Monte-Carlo - wrc.com</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Polo_R_WRC#Continued_dominance_(2015)\">Volkswagen Polo R WRC - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/times/18216-rallye-automobile-de-monte-carlo-2015/\">Stage times Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo 2015</A><BR/>"}
