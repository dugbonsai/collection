Koizumi/Y. Kikuchi</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2013<BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/en/line_up/index_930.php<BR/><BR/>The very first HPI release in 2006. I bought this to complement their <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=198405#p198410\">last release in 2013</A>. HPI had a great 7 year run. Here&apos;s the story behind the car from HPI&apos;s site (https://web.archive.org/web/20041108085016/http://www.hpiracing.com/coolstuff/provasubaru_about.htm) courtesy of the Internet Wayback Machine:<BR/><BR/>HPI Racing is proud to announce an exciting new sponsorship package in full-scale auto racing. HPI Racing is now the main sponsor of the Prova Racing Subaru Impreza STi entry in the 2004 Super Taikyu Endurance Series. The Super Taikyu Series consists of 8 endurance races throughout Japan at top racing circuits like Twin Ring Motegi and Suzuka, each race is around 3 hours long, driving duties are split between two drivers on each team. The HPI Racing Subaru will compete in Class 2, battling against other turbocharged Subaru Impreza STi cars and Mitsubishi Evo VIII cars. Prova Racing Division will field the entry, driven by Kazuhiro Koizumi and Yasushi Kikuchi. Of interest to R/C racers (and anyone that aspires to compete in real racing), team driver Kazuhiro Koizumi started his racing career driving radio controlled cars in the early 1990&apos;s, competing at many top 1/10th scale buggy and on-road races around the world.<BR/><BR/>The Subaru Impreza STi features bold HPI Racing graphics which help to promote radio controlled cars to hundreds of thousands of racing enthusiasts. The bold graphics were chosen for maximum impact in magazines and on TV, making the car easily recognizable to all R/C racing fans. To help further promote R/C cars, the sponsorship package also teams HPI up with other companies in the R/C industry, including RC Driver magazine, Hot Bodies, and Force Engines.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
