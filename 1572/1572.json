In October, 2001 signed up to drive for the Subaru World Rally Team with new co-driver Kaj Lindström for 2002, replacing Richard Burns who had moved to Peugeot. Expectations for the team, and Mäkinen, ran high.<BR/><BR/>In the 2002 season opening Rallye Monte Carlo, Mäkinen took the lead in SS3 but lost it to the up and coming Sébastien Loeb in SS4. By the end of the second day, Mäkinen was 28.2 seconds behind Loeb, but all of that would change after a steward’s meeting at the end of the second day. Loeb was awarded a two minute penalty for an infringement of the regulations ragarding the changing of tires in the final service on Saturday evening.<BR/><BR/>From the start of the third and final day, Loeb maintained the pace he had set through the rally to stay ahead of Mäkinen and - possibly - claim his first ever WRC win. Mäkinen backed off during the the stages believing that Loeb’s penalty would stand, but was later informed that the penalty had been reversed pending an appeal by Citroën. By the following Friday, Citroën had withdrawn their appeal and Mäkinen was officially the winner and the most successful driver in the WRC at the time with 24 wins. This was the high point of Mäkinen’s career as it was his last WRC win.<BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/photo/main-gallery/tommi-6/?&amp;i=65109&amp;id=19312&amp;sz=8&amp;s=-6\">Tommi Makinen at Rally Monte Carlo </A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommi_Mäkinen\">Tommi Mäkinen - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_World_Rally_Team#2002–2003\">Subaru World Rally Team - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/news/monte-carlo-subaru-leg-three-final-report/?v=2&amp;s=1&amp;q=2002+monte+carlo\">Monte Carlo: Subaru leg three (final) report</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.motorsport.com/wrc/news/citroen-withdraws-monte-carlo-rally-appeal/?s=1&amp;q=2002+monte+carlo\">Citroen withdraws Monte Carlo Rally appeal</A><BR/>"}
