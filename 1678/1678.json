Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/>The Japanese Grand Touring Championship (JGTC) series was established in 1993 to replace the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship (JSPC) series and the Group A class of the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTC) series. The JSPC was dissolved due to declining popularity and increasing budgets. The JTC Group A class was dissolved due to the fact that it had essentially become a one make series with the Nissan Skyline GT-R taking over the JTC-1 class.<BR/><BR/>Seeking to prevent the spiralling budgets and one-team/make domination the JGTC series imposed strict limits on power and heavy weight penalties on race winners in an openly stated objective to keep on-track action close with an emphasis on keeping the race goers happy. In its first ever race on March 28 1993, which was also an IMSA GT exhibition race, the only genuine JGTC cars were - you guessed it - two Nissan Skyline GT-Rs entered by NISMO.<BR/><BR/>Masahiko Kageyama qualified in second behind the Oldsmobile Cutlass  :!: of Tommy Riggins. Kageyama went on to win the race continuing the GT-R&apos;s winning ways.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_GT\">Super GT - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Japan_Sports_Prototype_Championship\">All-Japan Sports Prototype Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Fuji-1993-03-28-3455.html\">IMSA GT Fuji 1993 - Photo Gallery - Racing Sports Cars</A><BR/>"}
