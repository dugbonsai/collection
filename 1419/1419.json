Eriksson/P. Diekmann</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2013<BR/><BR/>1st WRC win for Kenneth Eriksson.<BR/>1st WRC win for Volkswagen.<BR/>Only WRC win for Volkswagen Golf GTi 16V.<BR/><BR/>This was VW&apos;s only WRC win until they returned to the WRC - 26 years later - in 2013. A WRC winner previously only available as a kit, this was finally released as part of the Passione Rally partswork in 2014. Quality-wise it is everything you would expect of a partswork model but, even so, the brush guard is a little off. It could use some Marlboro text logos but at least they put on the Marlboro red chevron logos. Sometimes IXO releases &apos;upgraded&apos; versions of partswork models so I&apos;m kind of hoping they do the same with this.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
