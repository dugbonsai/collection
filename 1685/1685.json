Hane/O. Hagiwara</b><BR/><BR/>Yukihiro Hane, Osamu Hagiwara, &amp; Shigeki Matsui (replacing Hagiwara in round 4) drove this Kenji HKS Racing Skyline GT-R in 6 of the 8 events in the 1992 JTC Series. Considering Hagiwara&apos;s name is on the model it&apos;s safe to assume this is not the car that raced in the Suzuka Super Touring Car 500km race. They went on to finish in 11th &amp; 12th place with their best result being a 4th place finish in the season finale Fuji 500km race. It&apos;s interesting to note that despite only competing in 1 event, Matsui finished just 3 places behind Hagiwara in 15th overall for the season.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">1992 Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1992%20AJTCC.html\">All-Japan Touring Car Championship - 1992</A><BR/>"}
