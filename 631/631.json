In 1963, the company introduced a new seden called the Fulvia featuring an unusual 1091-cc V-4 engine driving the front wheels and canted 45 degrees to lower the hood line. Unlike most vee-configuration engines, the cylinders of Lancia&apos;s V-4 shared a common iron block and were separated by a narrow 13-degree bank angle.</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.autoartmodels.com/web/product/en/1257\" TARGET=\"_blank\">The Fulvia coupe designed in-house by Pierro Castagnero debuted in 1965. Lancia competition director Ceasar Fiorio immediately began racing it under the company&apos;s HF (high fidelity) motorsport logo, eventually developing a 1584-cc engine making 160 hp. The Lancia Fulvia, dubbed the &quot;fanalone&quot; or &quot;big headlight&quot; because of its oversized highbeams, became the car to beat in rally, hill climb, and road racing through the late 60&apos;s and early 70&apos;s. Just 1280 1.6 HFs were built for the road to homologate the car for international rallying.</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.autoartmodels.com/web/product/en/1257\" TARGET=\"_blank\">http://www.autoartmodels.com/web/product/en/1257</A><BR/>"}
