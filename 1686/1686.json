Hasemi</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>HPI only released 3 models of racing Skylines from races outside of Japan, the <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=317048#p317048\">1991 Spa 24H winner</A>, <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=330191#p330191\">1993 Spanish Touring Car Championshp winner</A>, and this one. This is the 1990 Macau Guia Race winner driven by Mahahiro Hasemi.<BR/><BR/>The Macau Guia Race is held on the temporary 6.2km Guia Circuit on the streets of Macau. The Guia Circuit was originally conceived in 1954 as a route for a treasure hunt around the streets of the city. Shortly thereafter, it was suggested that the track could be used by local racing enthusiasts. Unlike other regular racing tracks in the world, the layout of the Guia Circuit has not been modified since its first event in 1954.<BR/><BR/>From 1983 - 1990 the race was run under Group A regulations. 1990 was the year that the Skyline GT-R name returned to racing after a 16 year absence so it was the first time it raced in the Macau Guia event. Hasemi qualified in first place and went on to win the race. It was the only win for Godzilla in the history of the event because the following year the Skylines were hit with a 140kg weight penalty and the previously dominant BMWs (&amp; other German makes) were allowed to run under DTM rules which allowed more powerful engines.<BR/><BR/>You can see Hasemi in action early on in the 1990 race <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/oqWrWsezrCo?t=5m58s\">here</A>.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.gta5-mods.com/paintjobs/1990-nissan-castrol-skyline-r32-gt-r-macau-gp-winner\">1990 NISSAN CASTROL SKYLINE R32 GT-R MACAU GP WINNER - GTA5-Mods.com</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guia_Race_of_Macau\">Guia Race of Macau - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guia_Circuit\">Guia Circuit - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://touringcarracing.net/Races/1990%20Macau.html\">1990 Macau Guia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://touringcarracing.net/Races/1991%20Macau.html\">1991 Macau Guia</A><BR/>"}
