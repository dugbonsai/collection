Auriol/B. Occelli</b><BR/><BR/>14th WRC win for Didier Auriol<BR/>26th WRC win for Toyota<BR/>14th WRC win for Toyota Celica GT-Four (ST185)<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Didier Auriol dominated the rally from start to finish, taking 13 stage wins out of 23 stages, and never ceding to lead to Carlos Sainz.<BR/><BR/>As for the model, it looks like this is around the time when HPI started highlighting the panel gaps (which was continued by Ignition). As much as I don&apos;t like it, at least highlight all of the panel gaps. Why only the door? While there were 16 winning ST185s, HPI only modeled 3 of them. It would have been nice to see more of these.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/48910/the-dirt-4-official-countdown-thread/p52\">The Dirt 4 Official Countdown Thread - Page 52 — Codemasters Forums</A> (photo)<BR/>Rally Giants: Toyota Celica GT-Four by Graham Robson<BR/>"}
