Berglund</B><BR/><BR/>The 1990 Dakar saw 465 competitors start from the La Défense district of Paris on 25 December 1990. The rally crossed France, Libya, Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal with 133 competitors finishing on 16 January 1990 for a total of 5,321 miles of special stages.<BR/><BR/>The 405 Turbo 16 raced in the Dakar was very different from the road-going 405. It was built in a coupe body style in mid-engine configuration, had constant four wheel drive with electronically-adjustable center differential like the 205 T16, as it was based on the same technology. Only two examples were made, one raced hill climbs and the other competed in the Paris-Dakar rally.<BR/><BR/>Wining 7 of the 20 special stages, 1981 World Rally Champion Ari Vatanen won the rally in a Peugeot 405 Turbo 16 making it his third win in four years. For their final outing in the Dakar, Peugeot scored a hat-trick with two 405s (A. Vatanen/B. Berglund and B. Waldegård/J. C. Fenouil) in first and second places and a 205 (A. Ambrosino/A. Baumgartner) in 3rd place.<BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images215?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCLaXyue68NC1WA&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images215?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCLaXyue68NC1WA&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/>"}
