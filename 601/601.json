Metge/D. Lemoyne</B><BR/><BR/><B>From Stuttgart To Dakar</B><BR/>A GT winning the Paris-Dakar, nobody would have believed it. And nobody would have seen it if Jacky lckx had not succeeded in convincing the Porsche factory to enter its flagship model, the 911.<BR/><BR/>In 1984 the Porsche 911 was at it&apos;s peak as an accomplished competitor. On the road, where it continued to win customers fond of performance and spectacle, and especially on the track. Rally, endurance, hill climbs; almost no type of racing is beyond its capabilities. &quot;Almost&quot; because it has not been tested in Rally Raid competition. Under the leadership of Jacky Ickx the factory in Stuttgart participated in their first competition in the sand. In 1983, Porsche introduced the prototype &quot;Gruppe B&quot;, which foreshadowed the fabulous 959. The Belgian driver tried to convince the factory to participate in the upcoming Paris-Dakar with cars based on this prototype. But they preferred to enter an experienced and reliable model, the 911. Since its introduction, the 911 has participated in numerous rallies around the world. The only flaw was that the 911 had rear-wheel drive but victory in the Paris-Dakar would not be possible without four-wheel drive. Porsche did produce a four-wheel drive 911 concept in 1981, and they would be able to test this concept in the race.<BR/><BR/><B>Old chassis...</B><BR/>The base of the Dakar 911 Dakar was none other than the Safari 911, an SC 3.0 with 280 horsepower that took part in the Safari Rally in 1978. Already strengthened and enhanced (with 25 cm of ground clearance), the car featured a four-wheel drive transmission, and drivetrain from the recent Carrera. The displacement of the flat-six engine was increased slightly to 3,164 cc but the power was reduced to 225 horsepower in favor of reliability. The factory also added some features specifically for long rallies such as the Paris-Dakar. Two fuel tanks allowed for 260 liters of fuel, the body and clutch were reinforced, and the suspension was reinforced as well: the 1984 Paris-Dakar 911 had two Bilstein shock absorbers per wheel. Finally, the rear window could be opened to allow access to the spare wheel and the second fuel tank. The weight of the car, 1,235 kg when empty, remained high. Combined with relatively modest power, the result was a car better adapted to  endurance than sprinting.<BR/><BR/><B>No. 1 for the flat-six</B><BR/>After development of the car was completed, the factory conducted tests in the Algerian desert. The 911 4x4 covered several thousand kilometers in the dunes in the fall of 1983. The drivers did not encounter any problems unless - like the Safari 911 -  it was due to some weakness in the suspension. The Porsche type 953 was now ready to tackle the dunes and rocky slopes of the Paris-Dakar. Three crews were formed: Jacky Ickx and Claude Brasseur (No. 175), Rene Metge and Dominique Lemoyne (No. 176), and Roland Kussmaul and Erich Lerner (No. 177). The role of the third car was not to participate in the race but to provide rapid assistance to the two leading crews. Note that the three cars entered in the Paris-Dakar were not entered by Porsche, but by Jacky Ickx himself with informal support from the factory. Metge won the Paris-Dakar, Ickx finished 6th despite many unpleasant circumstances, and Kussmaul finished in a fine 26th place. And, as expected, Porsche later participated in the Paris-Dakar with the 959, which won in 1986.<BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images226?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCILdiKay843z4QE&feat=directlink\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://picasaweb.google.com/109233223652492168348/Images226?authuser=0&amp;authkey=Gv1sRgCILdiKay843z4QE&amp;feat=directlink</A><BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=8649&p=224188#p224188\" TARGET=\"_blank\">http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8649&amp;p=224188#p224188</A><BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Norev La Légende Du Dakar #9 Porsche 953 1984 Dakar Rally Winner R.

As you can see they are a little too big which is quite noticeable on the sides. I also should have cut them a bit smaller - especially the one on the rear window. It passes the 3 foot test but not the closeup test.  :lol: <BR/><BR/>In 1984 the Porsche 911 was at it&apos;s peak as an accomplished competitor.
