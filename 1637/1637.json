Jonsson/L. Bäckman</b><BR/><BR/>First WRC win for M. Jonsson<BR/>22nd WRC win for Toyota<BR/>14th (&amp; last) WRC win for Celica GT-Four (ST165)<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The next generation Celica (ST185) campaigned by Toyota Team Europe (TTE) debuted in round 1 of the 1992 WRC at Monte Carlo. For the next round. however, Toyota Team Sweden entered 3 previous generation ST165&apos;s in the Swedish Rally for the teams of Markku Alén &amp; Ilkka Kivimäki, Mats Jonsson &amp; Lars Bäckman, and Leif Asterhag &amp; Christina Thörner. There were no signs of TTE, the new ST185s, or team leader Carlos Sainz.<BR/><BR/>Alén started as the clear favorite but had dropped to 9th place by the end of the 2nd stage. Jonsson took the lead in the 3rd stage and held it for the next 28 stages until the end of the rally. Even though it was a win for Toyota, it was a little embarrassing that it wasn&apos;t one of the new ST185&apos;s that won the event!<BR/><BR/>If you think the TOYOTA registration plate on the car is not legit, it is. As you can see in this video, <A HREF=\"<BR/>https://youtu.be/YFHD25qoZHg?t=7m24s\">Jonsson&apos;s car had TOYOTA plates</A> and <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/YFHD25qoZHg?t=8m50s\">Asterhag&apos;s car had GT 4 plates</A> The odd one out was Alén&apos;s car since you would think the plates might have been CELICA but they weren&apos;t.  :lol: <BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://web-rally.blogspot.com/2017/02/rally-sweden-1992.html\">WEB RALLY: Rally Sweden 1992</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.ewrc-results.com/eventstats/626-international-swedish-rally-1992/\">Stats International Swedish Rally 1992</A><BR/>Rally Giants: Toyota Celica GT-Four by Graham Robson<BR/>"}
