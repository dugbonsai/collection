Hoshino/M. Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/>Kazuyoshi Hoshino &amp; Masahiko Kageyama were teammates for the first time in 1992. In their first season together driving for Team Impul they had more wins that any other team in the (all-Skyline) JTC-1 class - 3. Unfortunately, they also had more DNFs than any other team - 3. They could have very well won the championship outright if not for these DNFs.<BR/><BR/>Here is a clip of one of those DNFs: https://youtu.be/uhPibq4faV8?t=7m51s<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">1992 Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
