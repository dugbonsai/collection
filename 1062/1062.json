Burns/R. Reid(1:43)</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2011<BR/><BR/>9th WRC win for Richard Burns.<BR/>32nd WRC win for Subaru.<BR/>3rd (and last) WRC win for Impreza GC WRC2000.<BR/><BR/>The model is quite nice considering it&apos;s well over 10 years old now. As far as I can tell this is the same as the regular Troféu 1120 release except for the signatures of Richard Burns and Robert Reid on the base and the special box. HPI never got around to the late-1990s Imprezas so Troféu is your only option. Even so, HPI really puts these to shame.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/> <BR/>"}
