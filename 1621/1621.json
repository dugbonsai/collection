Dacremont/C. Galli</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: http://www.hpimodelcar.com/line_up/pop/8244/8244.html<BR/><BR/>The distinctive red and pink livery of the rally cars of Team Aseptogyl is familiar to anyone acquainted with the European rally scene in the 1970s. Almost certainly unique, the team employed female drivers exclusively, and launched the careers of several international drivers.<BR/><BR/>The team was the brainchild of Bob Neyret, a French dentist and former rally competitor. Its first season of operation was 1971, and the cars were Alpine-Renault A110s, sponsored by Aseptogyl, a brand of toothpaste created by Neyret’s company. The Alpine factory supported the idea of an all-female team, and sold three Group 4-spec Alpine-Renault A110s to Neyret, plus a further car for himself. The engineering and preparation side of the team was handled by Autogyl, another of Neyret’s businesses. As well as the Aseptogyl branding, the team secured sponsorship from Esso.<BR/><BR/>Late in the 1976 season the team took delivery of a Lancia Stratos used by Christine Dacremont for European rallies. For 1977 the Stratos was still in use along with Alpine A310s and Toyota Celicas. Dacremont &amp; Colette Galli continued to use the Stratos to good effect finishing the Rallye Monte Carlo in 6th place.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"http://speedqueens.blogspot.com/2010/08/team-aseptogyl.html\">Speedqueens: Team Aseptogyl</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://www.emodels.co.uk/hasegawa-1-24-lancia-stratos-hf-1977-monte-carlo-rally-limited-edition-20268.html\">Hasegawa 1/24 Lancia Stratos HF 1977 Monte-Carlo Rally Limited Edition # 20268 from eModels Model Hobby Store based in the UK</A> (image)<BR/>"}
