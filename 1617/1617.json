Kageyama</b><BR/><BR/>Manufacturer page: http://ebbro.co.jp/item_japangp/4427312111111.html<BR/><BR/>1995 was the second season of the JGTC championship. Even with only 1 win for the season (actually no driver won more than 1 event in 1995) Masahiko Kageyama was the overall GT1 class champion for the 2nd consecutive year. This is a model of Kageyama&apos;s 12th place car from round 2, the All Japan GT Fuji. You can get a few glimpses of Kageyama in action in this <A HREF=\"https://youtu.be/GuhTLylJGnk?t=2m34s\">1995 JGTC Review</A>.<BR/><BR/>After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster Ebbro &amp; HPI announced a collaboration on a series of models to benefit the recovery efforts. 8 Skyline GT-R models and some (not sure how many) McLaren F1 GT-R models were released as a result. 4 Skylines were released with HPI part numbers and 4 were released with Ebbro part numbers.  The boxes for the Ebbro models were white with a red circle (mimicing the Japanese flag) while the boxes for the HPI models were the opposite.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/>Sources:<BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_All_Japan_Grand_Touring_Car_Championship\">1996 All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Fuji-1995-05-04-3448.html\">All Japan GT Fuji 1995 - Race Results - Racing Sports Cars</A><BR/>"}
