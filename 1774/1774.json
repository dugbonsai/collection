Hasemi</b><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>Due to the Nissan GT-R’s total domination of the Group A-based JTCC series from 1989-1993, the series switched to the <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Touring\">Super Touring</A> formula in 1994. In the 1993 season, 7 different teams were racing GT-Rs. After the switch to Super Touring, 5 of the teams left Nissan for the likes of BMW, Honda, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Opel. Unsurprisingly, the only team racing Nissans in the 1994 season was NISMO which now included the drivers from the Hasemi Motorsport team. Nissan raced the Primera (rounds 1-7 and 9) and Sunny (rounds 6-9) in 1994.<BR/><BR/>Masahiro Hasemi was one of the drivers to move from the Hasemi Motorsport team to drive one of the new Primeras (also known as the Infiniti G20). Hasemi’s best result of the season was a 4th place finish in round 3 at Tokachi International Speedway. He went on to finish the season in 6th place overall.<BR/><BR/>The model is HPI’s version of the Primera as it appeared for the mid-season races (round 4 at Suzuka Circuit and round 5 Mine Central Circuit) and was a web site limited edition run of 120 pieces. This model also has the dubious distinction of being one of the worst examples of the  the glazing lifting from the bodies of HPI’s resin releases.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/> <BR/><BR/><BR/><b>Sources</b><BR/><A HREF=\"http://blog.livedoor.jp/osamphoto/archives/5197875.html\">1994 JTCC Suzuka Circuit: Small photo house</A> (photo)<BR/><A HREF=\"http://hpimc-usa.jugem.jp/?eid=124\">Web Special Castrol Primera Sample | HPI USA Modelcar Blog</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">1993 Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/><A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Japanese_Touring_Car_Championship\">1994 Japanese Touring Car Championship - Wikipedia</A><BR/>"}
