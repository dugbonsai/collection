Biasion/T. Siviero</b><BR/><BR/>14th WRC win for Miki Biasion.<BR/>54th WRC win for Lancia. Lancia had the record for most WRC event wins at this time with 30 more than their nearest rival - Audi.<BR/>First WRC win for Lancia Delta Integrale 16V.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>The Integrale 16V made its debut on the 1989 Rallye Sanremo where, for the first and only time, it ran in Italian racing red. Lancia’s works entries for Sanremo consisted of two cars for Miki Biasion/Tiziano Siviero and Didier Auriol/Bernard Occelli. Auriol took the lead in the first special stage but a crash in stage 4 ended his rally. Biasion was in second place at the time so he took over as leader but lost the lead to Alessandro Fiorio - driving a Delta Integrave for the Jolly Club - in the very next stage.<BR/><BR/>Biasion’s first stage win came on stage 8 but Fiorio held the lead. 22 stages - and 13 stage wins - later Biasion took the lead from Carlos Sainz and held on to it through the end of the rally. The Italian team had already secured the Manufacturers’ Championship and this win meant Biaision would hold on to the Driver’s Championship. Lancia’s season came to an early end as they declined to contest the final round of the season, the RAC Rally.<BR/><BR/>HPI made two versions of this car.
