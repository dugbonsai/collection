Hasemi/K. Tohira</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2014<BR/><BR/>I have to say that there are a bewildering number of Skyline variations and permutations. Mix in the fact the people use terms like &quot;Turbo C,&quot; &quot;Group C,&quot; and &quot;Silhouette&quot; interchangeably when they refer to very different cars and it&apos;s nearly impossible to sort it all out. At least for me anyway... Matt summed it up best in <A HREF=\"http://www.scale143.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=8636&amp;start=48#p205552\">this post</A>:<BR/>It was a front engined Group C car with Skyline styling cues, that&apos;s about it.<BR/><BR/>Now that that&apos;s sorted, this is a very nice effort from Ebbro. Enjoy.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
