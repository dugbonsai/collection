Kankkunen/F. Gallagher</b><BR/><BR/>Purchased: 2012<BR/>Manufacturer site: http://www.bizarremodel.com/pics/bz215.html<BR/><BR/>First WRC win for Juha Kankkunen.<BR/>6th WRC win for Toyota.<BR/>3rd WRC win for Celica Twincam Turbo.<BR/><BR/>Prior to HPI releasing versions of the TCTs late last year the Bizarre versions were a holy grail of sorts for many collectors as they were the only manufacturer to produce any TCT models. They will undoubtedly look a little dated compared to the newer HPI versions but at least Bizarre supplied the Marlboro decals!<BR/><BR/>(from <A HREF=\"http://www.juwra.com/toyota_celica_tc.html\">Jonkka&apos;s World Rally Archive</A>:)<BR/>Toyota&apos;s first big-hitter was a curious design for a rally car, especially considering it&apos;s era. For two and half-years [i]before[/i] it&apos;s debut, Audi had demonstrated the might of four-wheel drive. Even so, for some reason Toyota decided not to take advantage of Group B rules and produce a limited run of special 4WD cars but settled on a RWD design instead. On top of that, it featured a live rear-axle and front-mounted engine with just two valves per cylinder, making it look like a rather dated design on paper.<BR/><BR/>All in all, these constraints made it uncompetitive in European events. On the other hand, the car&apos;s relatively simple design meant it was also reliable. Massive power output (320bhp) provided a very high top speed and so it was that Toyota Celica Twincam Turbo excelled where these qualities were in demand: long-distance rallies in Africa. It was so successful that it won all Safari and Ivory Coast rallies that Toyota entered from 1983 to 1986. This success paved the way for Toyota Team Europe&apos;s (TTE&apos;s) rise to the very top of the WRC with their Celica GT-Fours in the 1990&apos;s.<BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/><BR/>   <BR/>"}
