Fréquelin/J. Todt</B><BR/><BR/>The Talbot Sunbeam Lotus mated a small, well-balanced chassis and a powerful, well-developed Lotus twin-cam engine. Despite scoring only two wins in its short career, the car proved to be incredibly competitive and, as a result, French constructor Talbot scooped the 1981 Manufacturers&apos; World Rally Championship in only its second year. During that season, the car had a notable outing in Brazil, securing second place in an arduous event.<BR/><BR/>Despite its iconic status in World Rally Championship (WRC) history, the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus only scored two victories at the top level of the sport. Henri Toivonen&apos;s success in Britain&apos;s RAC Rally in 1980 was followed up by a win for Guy Fréquelin - now Citroën&apos;s WRC team boss - in Argentina in 1981.<BR/><BR/>However, the little Sunbeam was a model of consistency during its career, racking up numerous podium finishes in a cross-section of events. This great all-round ability helped Talbot to the Manufacturers&apos; World Championship in 1981 - only its second full year of WRC competition.<BR/><BR/>The Sunbeam&apos;s rise to prominence can be traced back to the late 1970s, when parent company Chrysler Europe&apos;s racing boss, Irishman Des O&apos;Dell, was busy guiding the firm&apos;s Avenger model to three British Touring Car Championship Titles. O&apos;Dell had worked in many different disciplines of international motor sport and was regarded as something of a canny operator. That was never more true than when the Avenger&apos;s replacement, the smaller and lighter Sunbeam, was launched.<BR/><BR/><B>POWER BOOST</B><BR/>O&apos;Dell was quick to spot the potential of the Sunbeam as a rally car. Its compact dimensions and straightforward engine and transmission package would make it ideal for WRC competition. But O&apos;Dell had one major concern: the 1300 cc motor wouldn&apos;t be powerful enough.<BR/><BR/>The solution, O&apos;Dell figured, was to fit the potent, 2.2-litre twin-cam Lotus engine. A quick chat with friend and Lotus boss Colin Chapman, one of Formula 1&apos;s most gifted and innovative engineers, secured O&apos;Dell the partnership he craved to allow him to take the Sunbeam to the top of the WRC. The 16-valve Lotus engine was shoehorned into the Sunbeam and the result was a hugely powerful, perfectly-balanced machine. So impressed was Chrysler, in fact, that it immediately gave the go-ahead to build the requisite 400 units that would enable the car to be homologated for the WRC&apos;s top class: Group 4.<BR/><BR/><B>A NAME TO CONJURE WITH</B><BR/>Before the car could be entered in rallies, a company name change meant that the Chrysler Sunbeam Lotus would become known as the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus. Chrysler Europe&apos;s parent company, the PSA Group, had ordered the name change and re-branding, but it wouldn&apos;t delay the car&apos;s arrival on the WRC scene.<BR/><BR/>Production of the car increased until it reached 1,000 units, which enabled it to compete in Groups 1 and 2 (the production-based categories), as well as the full-blown Group 4 class. Despite the modesty of Talbot&apos;s resources, put to the most efficient use under the watchful eye of Des O&apos;Dell, the Sunbeam immediately made an impression in an era that spawned the mighty, four-wheel-drive Audi Quattro - a car that would revolutionise the sport.<BR/><BR/><B>RAY OF SUNBEAM</B><BR/>After Henri Toivonen&apos;s maiden success at the end of 1980 and the team&apos;s securing of sixth in the Manufacturers&apos; Title, things looked promising for 1981. Victories would prove elusive, however, as Audi&apos;s new Quattro and Ford&apos;s venerable Mk2 Escort piled on the pressure on the little Sunbeam. The car&apos;s sole success that season (it would also prove to be its last) came in Argentina with Guy Fréquelin. The Frenchman, a former National Champion, only began to be noticed late in his career and his South American success was his first and only WRC victory.<BR/><BR/>After success in Argentina - and second place in Monte Carlo and Corsica - Fréquelin came to Brazil looking to consolidate his Drivers&apos; Title lead. Ironically, Talbot hadn&apos;t planned to contest the back-to-back South American events, but the Sunbeam&apos;s earlier competitiveness forced a change of heart.<BR/><BR/>Fréquelin only narrowly missed out on victory in the Brazilian event - the first time it had been a round of the WRC. His second place, however, ensured that he maintained his lead at the top of the Driver&apos;s Title points table. Finn Ari Vatanen won the event, in which only 19 of the 76 competing teams managed to reach the finish of the arduous competition.<BR/><BR/>Come the end of the year, however, Vatanen&apos;s three victories (Greece, Brazil and Finland) and second places in Sweden and Britain were decisive in the outcome of the Drivers&apos; Title battle. Fréquelin, meanwhile, had to make do with the runner-up slot. The Frenchman would never again come so close to securing the World Rally Title.<BR/><BR/><A HREF=\"https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipNi1OLHHBCfjIGBQ-E7al_RE2kZrnYRuOn7uPFF\" TARGET=\"_blank\">https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipNi1OLHHBCfjIGBQ-E7al_RE2kZrnYRuOn7uPFF</A><BR/>"}
